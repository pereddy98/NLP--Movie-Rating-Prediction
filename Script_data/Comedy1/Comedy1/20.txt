               FADE IN:               EXT. WOODS               The Rangers plun
ge into thick woods. Branches slap at them,               but the sound of gunf
ire keeps them going. Captain Malcolm               is still in the lead, flank
ed by two young men who are               obviously brothers. The big, handsome
 one is COLE YOUNGER;               the skinny one with the lopsided hair is BO
B YOUNGER.               EXT. WOOD'S EDGE               They break through the
other side of the woods, emerging               behind a rickety set of fence-p
ost fortifications. Instantly               GUNFIRE tears apart the trees aroun
d them. The Captain's               horse goes down, and the Younger brothers d
ive and roll to               hide beneath the palisade.               The Capt
ain, still alive, has fallen beyond the wooden               shield. Cole scram
bles through the savage rifle fire, grabs               Captain Malcolm, and ha
uls him behind the fortification.                                     CAPTAIN M

          he seems more angry than afraid. Next to him is WEB MIMMS,

 Cannon.               Frank raises his head just high enough to poke the Enfie

             the suppressing fire. Frank is perfectly still. Squinting,
       aiming, perfectly centered ... BANG.
                                CUT TO:               EXT. CANNON STATION
         As the Captain of the six man crew SNAPS BACK and hits the
   ground dead. Before the others can react, two more grab               their
throats and drop. The remaining soldiers bolt from the               cannon.
            But the Gatling crew swings the gun around and the barrels
      BLAZE.

 rounds are everywhere. Rangers jerk as the               Gatling tears them ap

e boy with his own body. When the               fire pauses for a moment. Jesse
 looks down -- he's covered               in blood. He lets Web fall away. Bloo

crying)                         I never even got to be with a girl.
   Web dies.               Jesse sighs. He's seen too much death to cry anymore
. He               stands up, pivots, and strides for the fencepost barrier.
            Rifle fire is zipping through the air all around him, but he
        keeps walking.               EXT. FORTIFICATIONS               Frank, t

HORSEBACK AT FULL               GALLOP EXPLODES from the woods, heading straigh

        GUNS -- two Colts at the hip, a crossed bandolier on his
chest with two cross-holstered Colts at the shoulders, and               two Co

          The horse hits the ground running. The Union troops are in
    shock as Jesse draws both his hip Colts and starts firing.

 cuts the horse hard left using just               his knees, still shooting as
 the Gatling volley goes wide,               actually killing two of the Union
soldiers behind Jesse.               But then the arc of fire takes Jesse's hor

and is               up and running, dropping the spent Colts and drawing the t

barrel and drives the butt straight               back into the soldier's nose.
 The Union boy falls, releasing               the gun. Jesse swings the rifle i
n a smooth arc, bashing               another soldier in the jaw, and then spin

his hand, twists it, wrapping the man's arm backward               around Jesse

es               the Gatling. Suddenly a FIGURE LEAPS UP from behind the
        Gatling and FIRES his rifle. A bloody streak tears Jesse's
  cheek and he stumbles onto his back. With a cry, the figure               jum
ps forward and buries his bayonet in Jesse's chest!               Jesse gasps,
then, puzzled, looks down. The bayonet has               lodged right in the "X

her. Jesse kicks. As the               Union soldier is knocked back, Jesse smo

oppy woman's Easter Sunday                         hats.
              JESSE                         That would have made an impression.
                                     FRANK                         I figure.
                                  JESSE                         See, that's you
r problem, Frank. By                         the time you finish figuring out
                       stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
                  FRANK                         No, Jesse, your problem is you'
re                         always doing stuff before I'm
  finished figuring it out.               Cole, Bob, and Comanche Tom RIDE UP o
n their recovered               horses. Cole jumps down and picks up Jesse in a
 bear hug.                                     COLE                         Wai
t'll we get back to Missouri,                         start telling those gals
about how                         little Jesse James charged the whole
                Union Army by himself!                                     COMA
NCHE TOM                         You ride like a Comanche.
                BOB                         You can ride like that?
                         COMANCHE TOM                         I said like a Com
anche, not this                         Comanche.               Cole mounts up,
 reaches down a hand to Jesse.                                     COLE
                 Ride with me, cousin?                                     JESS
E                         I could use the walk.
     COLE                         Suit yourself. We'll have some
          horses waiting for you at the road.                              (the
n)                         Let's ride, Rangers!               Cole slaps leathe
r and the Rangers canter off. As they               disappear we hear:
                            BOB                              (low)
            Now, I would just sound stupid                         saying somet
hing like that...               Jesse and Frank watch them go, then start walki
ng again.                                     JESSE
  (finally)                         Web's dead.
     FRANK                         I reckoned.
    JESSE                         Hell of a war.
      FRANK                         I'm sure it seemed like a good idea
                 at the time.               EXT. ROAD - DUSK               The
James brothers, the Youngers, and the other Rangers               ride down a d
irt road toward a ragtag column of Confederate               soldiers. The grey
 uniforms are ghostlike in the twilight.               The men are obviously br
oken, dispirited. The column               stretches down the road and around a
 bend as far as the eye               can see.               Jesse and the othe
r Rangers ride into the midst of the               Confederates who part and fl
ow around the horsemen like a               slow-moving river.               Fo
r a moment, nobody speaks while the whole eerie               procession glides
 past.                                     COLE                         Where y

  There's Yankees back there. Lot's                         of 'em.
   One grizzled Confederate VETERAN, his arm in a bloody               sling, l

       War's over, son. General Lee                         surrendered yesterd
ay at Appomattox.               The soldiers move on. The Rangers stare into th
e middle               distance of despair. Cole rubs his hands across his face

              COLE                         What do we do now?               Jes

    JESSE                         Home. We go home. We ride like hell
               to get there, and we kill anything                         or an
yone that comes between us and                         our homes. And when we g

                         Best damn plan I heard all war.               Jesse je
rks his reins, and the last remaining survivors of               the Missouri R
angers trot off into the sunset.               MONTAGE               -- Jesse,

 out to the                         reservation? Figure we might have
               some work for you, if you want.
    COMANCHE TOM                         Hmm. Go back to the reservation and
                      get drunk in a dirt shack, or work
  for you...                                     COLE                         W

    BOB                         It gets worse.               There in the cente

 hanging from the nooses.                                     FRANK

them down.               Cole starts to dismount. Jesse grabs his arm. The Unio

           JESSE                         Not now.

 want them to                         see us coming.               Cole thinks,

XT. MIMMS HOME - DAY               Jesse and Frank ride toward a handsome white
 two-story               frame house that stands in a grove of elm trees.
         ANOTHER ANGLE               They dismount and walk up to the porch. A
FARM HAND in a               cowboy hat is nailing a rail onto the porch.
                               JESSE                         Scuse me, we're he

 MIMMS.                                     ZEE                         Jesse!
Frank!               She hugs both of them enthusiastically. Jesse is obviously

JESSE  (CONT'D)                         I mean, I mean, in a good way you
                   got big and older.               Zee tilts her head. Jesse's
 mouth moves, but nothing comes               out, until
              JESSE  (CONT'D)                         Frank, don't you have som

         Zee, we got to talk to you and your                         father.
            DOC MIMMS, a grey-haired man wearing rimless spectacles,
    steps out of the doorway.                                     DOC MIMMS
                     Frank, Jesse.                              (looking)

T of the Mimms house. We can see, but not hear,               Jesse talking. A
beat, then we hear Zee CRY OUT.  Doc Mimms               staggers, SLUMPS DOWN
in the door frame. Jesse and Frank               rush to help him.

T. PARLOR - A WHILE LATER               The room is comfortable and elegant in
a simple way. Doc               Mimms is slumped in a big chair. Zee, her eyes
red, is               pushing a glass of sherry into his hands. Jesse and Frank
               sit across from him.                                     JESSE
                       -- rode right into them, screaming
   like a banshee.                                     DOC MIMMS
          My little Web did that?                                     JESSE
                     Pff. He jumped his horse clear over
  our heads, killed a dozen Union                         soldiers before they
knew what hit                         them.               Jesse looks at Frank,
 urging him on.                                     FRANK

 would have come                         home if not for Web Mimms, Doc.
                  God's honest truth.               Doc is fighting back tears,
 but proud.                                     DOC MIMMS
   Web died fighting?                                     JESSE
         Died a hero.                                     ZEE
            (quietly)                         But still died.
                   JESSE                         If there's anything we can do
for                         you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.
                  DOC MIMMS                         Start thinking about yourse
lves.                         You, the Youngers, Clell Miller, all
            of you. Don't end up like Charlie.                         They fou
nd out Charlie rode with                         Quantrill's Raiders. They arre
sted                         him, tried him by military tribunal
          and hanged him this morning.                                     FRAN
K                         I thought there was general amnesty.
                    DOC MIMMS                         For soldiers, yes. But if
 you rode                         in one of the partisan bands,
         they'll hang you for treason. And                         you boys are
 in more danger, because                         you've got a farm.
   Jesse and Frank don't understand.                                     ZEE
                      Daddy, don't start with this again.
               DOC MIMMS                         Zerelda, it's no coincidence.
The                         railroad men come through, offering
         to buy up land. Nobody sells. Then                         they start
hanging men who own farms                         for treason?
                    FRANK                         You're saying the railroad's
got                         the Army doing it's dirty work?
                 DOC MIMMS                         Rich men in Washington, don'
t                         matter if they wear a tie or a
  uniform, they're all the same.                                     JESSE
                    All we thought about was coming                         hom
e. I swore I'd kill anybody who                         tried to get me off my
farm again.                         If I have to go to war with the
             railroad to stay, fine by me.
FRANK                         Think about this. If we just come
         up with a story and stick to it, we                         should be
all right.                                     JESSE                         Wh
at kind of story are they going                         to believe?
                         ZEE                         Hmm. You were in the Confe
derate                         Army with General Hood's Texas Army
            until... say Sharpsburg, then you                         were reas
signed to General Jeb                         Stuart's cavalry until you
                  surrendered in Tennessee.               Pause. The men stare
at Zee. Up goes the eyebrow again.                                     JESSE
                      That just might work.
 FRANK                         Maybe, maybe...

 For everything.                         Especially that story you told my

       I'm going to go cry now, so I don't                         have time fo

        CLOSE ON:               Frank shaking his head as they ride away.
                               FRANK                         That Zerelda turne
d into a hell of                         a woman, eh --               WIDEN TO
REVEAL Jesse's not next to him. Frank turns.               Jesse's still starin
g at the door.  Frank rides back, takes               Jesse's horse by the rein
s.  As Frank turns Jesse's horse               and leads it away, Jesse's head
keeps pivoting, fixed on the               door. After a moment, Jesse turns to
 look forward, taking               his reins.               The brothers ride
away slowly.                                     FRANK  (CONT'D)
          "Big and older"?                                     JESSE
              You can shut up now.                                     FRANK

s into it.               EXT. JAMES FARM - DAY               Jesse and Frank ri
de up. Out of the farmhouse bursts MA               JAMES, a big, rugged fronti
er woman who is absolutely               hysterical.
          MA                         My boys! My boys!               She hauls
Jesse and Frank clean out of their saddles.
 MA  (CONT'D)                         My boys are alive!
              FRANK                              (strangling)
       Not if you don't ease up a bit,                         Ma...
    She looks at both at arm's length.                                     MA
                       Did you kill Yankees?
  JESSE                         A fair number, Ma.
        MA                         Say your prayers?
          FRANK                         Every night, Ma.
              MA                         Good. Now get inside and wash up
                   for dinner.               INT. JAMES HOME               Jess

 a gawky 15 year old JIM YOUNGER all eating               at their kitchen tabl
e.                                     FRANK                         Well look
at Jimmy Younger. You're                         all grown up.
                    JIM                              (mouth full)
           Mmmph-hmpph.                                     BOB
              (sheepishly)                         Your Ma wouldn't let us leav
e until                         we ate something.
       COLE                         That was two hours ago.
                 MA                         I don't see clean plates.
     The men dutifully return to the meal. Jesse nods his head               at
 Comanche Tom.                                     JESSE
       (quiet)                         Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice
                   to our Injun friend.                                     MA
                        He's a good Christian and he killed
     Yankees. Jesus told me that made him                         an all right
boy.               Ma WALKS OFF.                                     FRANK
                    She's still talking to Jesus.
       JESSE                         What worries me is that Jesus is
               talking back.               EXT. JAMES FARM               We can
 hear the laughter from inside the lit house. Night               falls and

       EXT. JAMES FARM - DAY - A FEW WEEKS LATER               Like a time-laps
e film we see the surrounding trees have               filled out, the stone fe
nce is repaired, the shabby paint               redone in sparkling white. Jess
e and Cole, shirtless, are               driving a post into a hole. Frank STEP
S OUT of the house and               joins them.
      JESSE                         You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
                         COLE                         She got two of them.
                                FRANK                         I think one of 'e

 laughs as Cole raises the shovel to strike Jesse.
        FRANK                         Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at

The post finally drops straight into the hole. Jesse and               Cole shr
ug into shirts and grab a pitcher of lemonade.
    JESSE  (CONT'D)                         Thanks for the help.

         COLE                         It was exciting.
            JESSE                         But it was a whole lot of killing.
                      Why should we miss that?
    COLE                         Because we were good at it?  Hell,
             we were great at it. Jesse, don't                         tell any
one I said this, because                         everybody knows I'm the toughe

            now working under contract to Mr.                         Thaddeus

d                         Pacific Railroad?
 FRANK                         You know him?
  JESSE                         Heard of him.
   PARKER                              (trying to regain
       control)                         As you have no doubt heard from
                 your neighbors, our railroad is                         moving
 west.                                     JESSE                         That m
akes sense, as east would put                         you underwater.
     Pinkerton coughs a laugh. Parker glares at him and               continues
.                                     PARKER                         ... moving
 west, opening the                         frontier for folks such as yourself.
                         Your acreage here is on the proposed
       right of way.               Parker produces a piece of paper. Ma takes i
t.                                     PARKER  (CONT'D)
 I'm here for your signature on this                         land sales contrac
t. I'm authorized                         to pay you two dollars an acre.
                               MA                         Two dollars?
                            PARKER                         That's right. That's
 the price                         authorized by the railroad's board,
                and approved by the Department of                         the I
nterior of the Government of                         the United States of Ameri

n't for sale.               Pinkerton steps forward.
          PINKERTON                         Ma'am, I can understand how you
                     might feel that way -- you've made a
   lovely home here. But it's really                         not up to me or yo
u. Are you                         familiar with the legal concept of
               the Right of Eminent Domain?
 FRANK                         Yeah, I am. What about it?               Parker
is surprised. Pinkerton has become interested in               these farmers.
                                   PINKERTON                         Well, this
 land is about to be                         condemned.
             PARKER                         I'm doing you folks a favor --
                                COLE                         Said the skinner t
o the mule.                                     PARKER
-- with a price of two dollars an                         acre for this one tim
e only offer.                         After today the price goes down. So
                   if I were you, I'd just sign the                         con
tract, and I'll be on my way.               Frank takes the contract from Ma an
d hands it back to               Parker.                                     FR
ANK                         Good day, Mr. Parker You can tell
       Mr. Thaddeus Rains to put this where                         the sun don
't shine.                              (to the boys)                         Sh

   Ah.               Parker flushes with anger. Pinkerton and his men rest thei
r               hands on their guns.                                     PINKER
TON                         I don't think you understand. You
       don't have a choice.               CLICK CLICK and we see Jesse's drawn
and cocked two Colts               from out of thin air. Frank has pulled his r
ifle from the               doorway. Parker and the detectives are furious, but
               Pinkerton seems no more than curious.
          PARKER                              (to Ma)                         M
a'am. You have to look in your                         heart and do what you kn
ow is right                         here.                                     M
A                         Let me ask the Lord.               Ma bows her head f
or a moment. She then nods and looks up.                                     MA
  (CONT'D)                         The Lord says we can bury 'em out
              back in the orchard, nobody'll ever                         find
them.                                     JESSE                         Somebod
y's in a vengeful smiting                         mood today.
                   FRANK                         Why don't we just let them go
for                         today, Ma. We'll bury them out back
         next time.                                     MA
    Oh all right.               Parker, and the detectives are stepping backwar
d to the               buggy.                                     PARKER
                  You people are making a serious                         mista
ke!               Pinkerton himself has lingered, taking in the group.
                            PINKERTON                              (nodding)
                      Nicely played.               Parker, Pinkerton and the de
tectives RIDE OFF. The group at               the James house watches them go,
then Cole turns to Jesse.                                     COLE
            Where the hell did you get those                         guns?

  Dozens of men and a few women are packed into the one room               scho
ol house. Among them are Frank and Jesse. Doc Mimms is               leading th
e meeting.                                     FRANK                         I
went up to the courthouse and                         looked at the right of wa
y documents                         for the rail bed. The railroad
            doesn't even need our land, they're                         just ta
king the land on both sides                         for as far as they can.
                                 JESSE                         Damn. All that r

                       It would be, if the courts were on

     So what do we do?               ANGLE ON               the school house do
or as it BANGS open and Bob Younger               STUMBLES IN, bleeding from a
cut on his forehead, being               supported by Zee.
                BOB                         They got Cole.               He col
lapses into a seat. The crowd surrounds him.
  ZEE                         He came to our house, Daddy. I
      figured you'd all want to hear this.               Jesse and Frank are ne
xt to Bob. Zee puts a hand on Jesse's               shoulder. He notices.
                               BOB                         They came up, made t
he same offer                         they made you folks. Our little
               brother Jim tried to chase 'em off,                         one
of those detectives hit him in                         the head, knocked him ou
t. Cole lost                         his temper.
      FRANK                              (rubbing his
    forehead)                         Oh no...
    BOB                         He just lost his temper a little.
                       JESSE                              (sighing)
             How many of them did he kill?
BOB                         Two.                                     FRANK

                     FRANK                         The Army can hang him.
                               BOB                         Tomorrow.
                          CLELL                         What do we do?
                            JESSE                         Nothing.
  The crowd stares at Jesse.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D
)                         You folks are going to do nothing.
      You're all going to go home right                         now. So you're
going to be able to                         swear on a Bible that you don't kno
w                         anything about what's going to
  happen tomorrow.               Jesse's gaze is at once noble and terrifying.
The crowd               quietly begins to disperse.
         DOC MIMMS                         Boys...
        JESSE                         Go home, Doc.
  (softly)                         They ain't gonna hang no more
          Liberty boys.               Doc Mimms nods, EXITS.               Jess
e walks to the other end of the school house. Bob,               Frank, Clell a
nd Loni fall in behind him. The door SWINGS               OPEN again and Comanc
he Tom enters with Jim Younger sporting               six-guns way too big for
him.                                     COMANCHE TOM                         I
 couldn't lose him.                                     BOB
     Jim Younger, I told you--                                     JIM
                It's my fault they're gonna hang                         Cole.
I want in.                                     FRANK                         Ji

                  detectives in broad daylight in the                         m
iddle of Main Street.               Jesse smiles.
       BOB                         He's smiling.
      JIM                         Is that bad?
    FRANK                         Very.               EXT. LIBERTY CITY GALLOWS
 - THE NEXT DAY               Soldiers flank the gallows, which stand at the bo
ttom of               the stairs to City Hall. A small drum corps beats a stark
               rhythm.               Parker is watching this like a sideshow. P
inkerton is next               to him, scanning the crowd of locals which is ge
tting larger               and surlier by the minute.
           PARKER                         Relax, Alan. The Army has this all
                      in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will
    be very pleased with this news.                         Nothing like a hang
ing to motivate                         the populace to relocate.
                       PINKERTON                         It's not my job to rel
ax. I've put                         men facing out both ways down Main
                 Street, so nobody can ride in                         shooting
. I've got a sharpshooter up                         on the water tower just in
 case.               Pinkerton WAVES to a FIGURE in a suit atop the water tower
.                                                                    CUT TO:
            EXT. WATER TOWER               We see it is FRANK JAMES in the suit
, who WAVES BACK and               then kneels and sights down his long rifle.
Tucked away               behind him, out of sight from the street, is a
        bound-and-gagged PINKERTON SNIPER in his underwear.
                                                CUT TO:               EXT. GALL
OWS               Cole, his face swollen from a beating, is marched up the
          stairs of the gallows toward the waiting hangman.               LONG
SHOT               of the gallows, detectives and soldiers down the street on
             both sides, guns ready. The position is completely               u
nassailable. Cole is at the platform. His hands are tied in               front
 of him. The noose is placed on his neck.               BACK TO               T
he gallows. Parker leans forward in anticipation. A UNION               LIEUTEN
ANT approaches with the black hood. Cole spits in his               face. The C
ROWD ROARS. The Lieutenant angrily motions to the               HANGMAN, who gr
abs the lever --               The drums STOP --               But the drumming
 doesn't.               The drum corps look at each other, confused. The Army m
en               and the Pinkertons squint in concentration. There's
    definitely some sort of rhythmic DRUMMING, coming closer...               T
he CROWD, sensing something, easing back from the               gallows...
          The drumming gets LOUDER ...               EXT. STREET
REVEAL Fifty-odd CATTLE suddenly STAMPEDING from down the               street,
 their hooves creating the drumming!               REACTION SHOTS as the Pinker
tons and Army men start to               scatter, the cattle surging around the
m --               EXT. VIEWING STAND               ANGLE ON Parker and Alan Pi
nkerton running for cover,               Pinkerton half-turned to watch the act
ion.                                     PINKERTON                         Bril
liant...               Pinkerton suddenly spots something confusing. We FOLLOW
his               stare to see --               ANGLE ON               a HORSE
in the middle of the cattle, cutting through the               steer, towards t
he gallows.               THE HANGMAN REACHES FOR THE LEVER AGAIN, BUT JUST AS
HE               DOES -               Jesse -- masked -- appears from the side
of the horse,               where he's been hanging on Indian-style. He gets a
leg up on               the horse's back and LEAPS --               SLAMMING in
to the Hangman, bringing him down!               The cattle pass the gallows, r
evealing that the tight ranks               of the Army and Pinkertons are now
spread out --               EXT. GENERAL STORE               SMASH! From the ne
arby GENERAL STORE, the other masked               rescuers CRASH through the b
ig front window on horseback and               ride into the Army men, FIRING A
WAY.               TOTAL CHAOS! The Army men and Pinkertons fight towards the
             gallows. As Jesse untangles himself from the Hangman, the
      Union Lieutenant reaches for the lever but BANG drops as               Fr
ank opens fire.               Frank starts picking off soldiers. The detectives
 and               remaining soldiers are completely disoriented.
 EXT. GALLOWS               Jesse flashes a knife and the noose drops away from
 Cole's               neck. Facing Cole, he cuts the rope on Cole's wrists --
             Cole instantly draws Jesse's guns from his waist holster,
      spin-reverses them and SHOOTS two Union soldiers climbing               t
he stairs behind Jesse's back.  Jesse and Cole exchange a               look, t
hen Jesse steps away --               As Bob rides by he TOSSES JESSE'S GUNBELT
 into the air.               Jesse draws both guns from the belt as it flies by
, spins               and starts shooting.               EXT. MAIN STREET
         The soldiers have totally broken ranks. One riderless horse
    led by Comanche Tom pulls up by the scaffold. Jesse LEAPS ON
and Cole jumps on behind him. Jesse puts the spurs to it and               the
horse SURGES into a gap in the crowd.               Allen Pinkerton steps past
the panicking troops, squarely               in the path of the charging horse.
 He draws his gun and               FIRES. The bullet PLOWS into Jesse just as
the terrified               horse lurches forward, TRAMPLING Pinkerton.
       Cole holds Jesse up and the riders take off down the               stree
t. We see Frank has disappeared from the water tower.               The soldier
s fire at the fleeing liberators. One of the               detectives runs over
 to the injured Alan Pinkerton.                                     DETECTIVE
                       Sir, are you all right?                              (sh
out)                         Somebody get a doctor!               EXT. MIMMS HO
ME - NIGHT               WE SEE one window upstairs with a light on.
    INT. BEDROOM               Doc Mimms has just finished bandaging Jesse, who
 lies               unconscious beneath the sheets. Zee is holding an oil lamp.
                                     ZEE                         He's going to
be fine, right Daddy?                                     DOC MIMMS
             The bullet came out clean, but he                         lost a w
hole lot of blood. Praying                         wouldn't hurt.
 The SOUND OF HOOFBEATS APPROACHES from outside.               INT. LIVING ROOM
               Doc Mimms opens the door. A UNION OFFICER and a squad of
       soldiers push in.                                     OFFICER
              Good evening, sir, we're looking                         for a fu
gitive.                                     DOC MIMMS                         A
 fugitive? Who?                                     OFFICER
     We don't know, but he was very                         badly wounded. We'r
e checking all                         the houses in the area.               IN
T. BEDROOM               Zee hears her father protesting, then FOOTSTEPS on the
               stairs. Quickly she undresses, grabs a quilt from a chest
        and jumps into bed with Jesse. She pulls the quilt up to her
    neck, completely hiding him.               At that moment, the Officer barg
es in. Zee lets out a               little gasp as if startled awake. She cover
s herself with               the quilt.                                     ZEE
                         Sir! Who are you?
OFFICER                         Oh. Sorry ma'am.
      ZEE                         I should hope so.               The Officer E
XITS. Zee watches the door for a moment, then               looks down fondly a
t Jesse.                                     ZEE  (CONT'D)
    Jesse, are you awake?                                     JESSE
                  (groggy)                         Mmmm.               Zee gent
ly pushes his hair off his face. Then her               expression changes.
                                 ZEE                         Jesse, is that you
r hand?                                     JESSE                         Nuh-h
uh ...               Jesse smiles in his sleep. Zee jumps out of the bed and
            wraps a dressing gown around herself. Doc Mimms enters.
                         DOC MIMMS                         They're gone. What a
re you --                                     ZEE                         I foo
led them into thinking I was                         alone.
                 DOC MIMMS                         Well, I hope the boy pulls t
hrough.                         We should know in the morning.
                    ZEE                              (with a little smile)
                    I think he's already feeling better.               A puzzle
d Doc Mimms follows her out.               EXT. LIBERTY MAIN STREET - AFTERNOON
 - TWO WEEKS LATER               A lavishly appointed carriage rolls up to the
front of the               nicest hotel in town. Rollin Parker and his retinue
of               Pinkerton detectives scurry to the door.               The DOO
R OPENS. Out steps THADDEUS RAINS, wearing an               elegant suit he bou
ght in London last year and a scowl he               picked up in Boston three
decades ago. The scowl fits him               better.
           PARKER                         Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a
                    pleasure to have you join us in the
 field.                                     RAINS                         And i
t is my pleasure to be here.                                     PARKER
                 Really!                                     RAINS
            NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have                         to leave
my board room to come to                         this godforsaken piece of dirt
 to                         discover why in the name of all that
          is holy you cannot seem to evict a                         few simple
 farmers from their                         PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I
                        may build the GREATEST railroad that
      this country has ever seen!                                     PARKER
                      I can completely understand your
distress, sir.               Rains sighs. As he speaks, he checks a heavy, gold
, ornate               and ever-present POCKETWATCH on a GOLD CHAIN.
                          RAINS                         Parker, tell me what's
going on so                         I can return as quickly as possible
                 to Boston and my whores and cigars,                         no
t necessarily in that order.                                     PARKER
                 Two weeks ago, we managed to                         arrange t
o have the Army hang one of                         the local farmers.
                            RAINS                         Good.
                     PARKER                         Unfortunately not, sir. A g
ang of                         local thugs managed to rescue him
          from the gallows. Not only has this                         inspired
resistance from the other                         farmers, the redoubtable Mr.
Alan                         Pinkerton was seriously injured
      during the incident.                                     RAINS
              Leaving you in charge of operations                         until
 he recovers.                                     PARKER
       (puffing with pride)                         Yes sir.
                  RAINS                         Just perfect.
                   PARKER                         A further impediment is that
the                         Army garrison has been ordered to
       move on from Liberty. We will no                         longer have tha
t particular stick                         with which to threaten the farmers.
                                    RAINS                         You see the A
rmy leaving and you                         see the loss of a tool. I see a
                     power void to be filled. As we have
  the most power, we may move with                         impunity.
                          PARKER                         I see. I'll get togeth
er four                         patrols of our detectives for action
              tonight.                                     RAINS
          I'll teach these podunks what                         happens when th
ey challenge the                         righteousness of progress.
   EXT. MIMMS HOME - AFTERNOON - THAT SAME DAY               Zee is on the porc
h. Jesse COMES THROUGH the door, moving               gingerly. Zee immediately
 moves to support him.                                     ZEE

        No! I mean, of course not. No.                                     ZEE
                        Teasing you is completely unfair.
               JESSE                         What you do to me is unfair. The
                       teasing, I mean.                                     ZEE
                         I shouldn't tease a hero.
        JESSE                         What?
 ZEE                         Everybody in the county knows it
       was you who rescued Cole. We're all                         so proud of
you, Jesse. And not a                         single farm's been sold to the
                      railroad since. You're everybody's
  hero.                                     JESSE                         I was
n't the only one risking my                         neck that day.
                        ZEE                         So you're saying I should l
eave you                         alone and go spend time with Jimmy
             Younger?                                     JESSE
         Unfair. You are completely unfair.               They look at each oth

             FRANK                         You ready to stop loafing around
                     with this young lady and get back to
   farming?                                     JESSE                         W
hat do you think?                                     FRANK
     Would you get in the carriage?                         Until Ma has you ho
me so she can                         fuss over you herself, she's gonna
                  make me miserable.               Doc Mimms COMES OUT onto the
 porch.                                     JESSE                         What
do you say, sir?                                     DOC MIMMS
        Go on. You're pretty much all                         healed up.
        Jesse and Zee exchange glances. Zee withdraws demurely into
   the house. Jesse straightens up and hops easily into the               carri
age.                                     FRANK                         You're l
ooking a bit more spry now                         that somebody --
                         JESSE                              (to Frank)
                Shut up.                              (to Doc Mimms)
              Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh,                         this eve
ning, I could come by?                                     DOC MIMMS
              You know you're welcome any time!
     JESSE                              (unusually awkward)
     Yesss, but I was thinking, I could                         come by, and th
en take Zee out. Some                         place near. With other folk. Near
.                         Here.                              (beat)
             But out.                                     DOC MIMMS
                  (bemused)                         It's fine by me, Jesse.
                                 FRANK                         Don't worry, sir
, I'll make sure                         they're always properly chaperoned.
            Jesse slooooowly turns to glare at Frank.
           DOC MIMMS                              (grinning)
      Why, that hadn't even occurred to                         me, Frank. I am
 deeply in your debt.                                     FRANK
         Army's leaving town, so Cole can                         stop hiding u
p in the woods and come                         back to his farm. Everybody's
                       getting together at the Younger
place for a to-do.               Frank tips his hat, and the carriage MOVES OFF
.               EXT. BARNYARD - NIGHT               Dozens of people are millin
g about happily in the lantern               light of a Western party. Some are
 dancing to the small               banjo-led band. A small knot of men are com
paring war               stories. Cole Younger is wandering among them, people
              clapping his shoulder, shaking his hand.               Jesse -- f
ormally accompanying Zee -- and Frank arrive at               the edge of the l
ight. Immediately the entire group bursts               into applause and crowd
s Jesse. Cole cuts through and bear               hugs Jesse, making him wince.
                                     COLE                         Here's Libert
y's favorite son!                              (quietly)
  I'll never forget what you did,                         cousin.
                       BOB                         Zee, I'm pleased you came.
                                   ZEE                         Why thank you, B
ob.                                     BOB                         I'm especia
lly pleased you came                         with Jesse.
       (off her look)                         Seeing as right now there's a
                     gaggle of girls hoping to dance with
   Jesse who are just going to have to                         settle for the m
any charms of Bob                         Younger.               ANGLE ON
         A group of obviously disappointed, beautiful young women.
  Bob runs a hand through his hair.                                     JESSE
                       You have no shame.                                     B
OB                         Not yet. But I'm hoping.               The party sta
rts up again, and everyone is caught up in the               good times.
        ANGLE ON               Jesse SWINGING Zee into a group of dancers. They
 join in               the Two-Step, and Jesse's as smooth as silk.
   EXT. HILLSIDE - NIGHT - A WHILE LATER               Jesse, carrying a lanter
n, and Zee are walking. We can hear               the party still going just a
little ways away. They reach a               tree at the hilltop with a beautif
ul view of the stars and               the river. They sit down, their backs ag
ainst the tree.                                     JESSE
   I used to come to this tree when I                         was a kid and ima
gine what my life                         would be like when I got older.
                               ZEE                         You didn't want to f
arm?                                     JESSE                         I was th
inking more along the lines                         of being a river pirate.
                                  ZEE                         A river pirate.
                                   JESSE                         Arr. Hand over
 your jewels, Missy.                                     ZEE
      Thank God you grew out of that.                              (pause)
                    You did grow out of that, didn't                         yo
u?                                     JESSE                         Mostly. It
 would be an all right                         life, for a bachelor.
                          ZEE                         You planning on being a b
achelor                         your whole life, Jesse James?
                   JESSE                         Not if I find the right girl.
                                    ZEE                         And what's this
 right girl like?                                     JESSE
     Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes                         me think she's t
wo steps ahead of                         me. And big buck teeth.
                       ZEE                         Where will you find such a g
irl?                                     JESSE                         Honestly
, you'd do if only you had                         the buck teeth.
  Zee fakes a monstrous overbite.                                     JESSE  (C
ONT'D)                              (dreamy)                         Finally.
             The two move a little closer. Eye contact.
             JESSE  (CONT'D)                         Ahem. "From this doctrine.
.." No,                         ah... "From women's eyes this
       doctrine I derive, they sparkle                         still like ... s
hiny... sparkling                         rocks..."
         ZEE                         Sparkling rocks?
           JESSE                         Little ones.
           ZEE                         Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare
                   poems you're trying to quote?
      JESSE                         Yep.                                     ZE
E                         Were you planning on kissing me
   when you finished quoting?                                     JESSE
                 I've been planning on kissin' you                         for
a very long time.               They kiss. It's everything it should be.
        BOOM!               Jesse and Zee are startled by a flash of light and
sound.               They turn to look back --               EXT. YOUNGER BARN
              The partygoers are RUNNING from the YARD to the BARN, which
         is ON FIRE in several different places. As the Younger               b
rothers and Frank get close, they see a squad of masked               riders di
sappearing down the road. Some of the men SHOOT at               the riders, bu
t the distance is too great.               Jim makes a run for the BARN, but Bo
b grabs him.                                     COLE                         B
ASTARDS! Come back here and face                         me!
                  FRANK                         Get buckets!               Some
 of the crowd starts to form a bucket line to the well.               Jesse and
 Zee RUN UP. Frank turns to him.                                     FRANK  (CO
NT'D)                         Pinkertons. It's the railroad.
                  JESSE                         Ma.               Frank and Jes
se bolt for their horses, swing into the               saddles and GALLOP OFF.
              EXT. JAMES HOUSE               From a bit down the road, looking
just fine. Jesse and               Frank reign in as relief rushes across their
 faces --               AN EXPLOSION tears the house apart like a pile of
         matchsticks! Jesse and Frank urge their horses into a full
   gallop.               EXT. YARD               Jesse and Frank leap from thei
r mounts, trying to get close               to the house. The flames are too st
rong.                                     JESSE                         Ma! Ma!
               Jesse's ventured so close his coat catches fire. Frank
     tears it from him and stamps it out. Jesse ignores him,               stil
l pacing back and forth in front of the inferno.
      JESSE  (CONT'D)                         Ma! Please!
               MA (O.S.) (O.S.)                              (weakly)
               Boys?               The brothers turn and nearly drop from shock
. Ma is               stumbling toward them, half her hair singed off, brutally
               BURNED.                                     FRANK
          Jesus mercy --               They reach her just as she collapses. Je
sse is cradling               her, Frank with his arms around both of them.
                                 MA                         Riders --
                           JESSE                         We know, Ma. Now we go
t to get you                         to Doc Mimms.
        MA                         Take care of each other, boys. You
               say your prayers.               Jesse is openly crying. Frank ha
s tears silently streaming               down his face.
             JESSE                         Doc Mimms will --
                  MA                         Shush.               Ma's eyes tur
n up, and she half-smiles.                                     MA  (CONT'D)
                     Well look at that. The Good Lord's
 a bit shorter than I reckoned.               Ma gently stops breathing.
        ANGLE ON               The boys holding Ma, framed by the roaring flame
s of their               home. Jesse leans his head back and lets out a HOWL OF
 RAGE               AND PAIN AND HATE that goes on and on and on...
                                                   DISSOLVE TO:               E
XT. JAMES FARM - MORNING               Frank and Jesse are staring at the smoki
ng ruins of their               lives. Other townsfolk are milling nearby, incl
uding Zee and               the Youngers.                                     F

K                         Didn't think you would.
(turning away)                         I'm going to go make the coffin.
                             JESSE                         Make a thousand of '

           They stare at him.                                     JESSE  (CONT'
D)                         This isn't a feud, this is war.
    They've got more men than we do. We                         kill detectives
, they can replace                         'em in a day.
              COLE                              (snapping)
    So what do we do, General Lee?                                     JESSE
                      Just like in the war. Harass their
  supply lines. We kill the railroad's                         men, they won't
care.                                     BOB                         But if we
 take their money and                         supplies...
               JESSE                         Exactly.
           JIM                         That's a great plan, Jesse!

         I'll get us a few more men, and                         Comanche Tom'l
l ride with us.                                     JIM
 Where do we hit first, Jesse?                                     COLE
                 I'll pick the first job! I mean...                         I k
now a girl down at the bank. See                         if she can't get a lis
t of towns                         where the railroad keeps its money.
                            JESSE                         Perfect, Cole.
                              COLE                         Let's ride.
      The Youngers mount up. Jesse walks to the ruined house,               pul
ls a big iron trunk from the wreckage. He KICKS it open,               reaches
in, and pulls out his gun belts. Zee appears behind               him in what r
emains of the doorway.                                     ZEE
        I am so sorry, Jesse.                                     JESSE
                 Frank and me have to go away for a                         whi
le.               Zee considers this, puts her head in close to Jesse's.
                              ZEE                         You and I, we've star
ted...                         something, you know?
  (Jesse nods)                         I don't know what'll happen if you
                   do this.                                     JESSE
               Me neither.                                     ZEE
            Let the law --                                     JESSE
              Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus                         Rains.
 Only justice does.                                     ZEE
     Whose justice? Yours or God's?                              (no answer)
                      When will you stop?                                     J
ESSE                         When my name makes them cry in
     their sleep. When I've brought them                         to ashes.
          Jesse kisses her gently, turns and walks to where the               Y
oungers are standing. Zee can barely conceal her anger and               heartb
reak.                                                               DISSOLVE TO

            There are two teller windows, a couple of male customers
    and a MOTHER and CHILD.               Jesse and Cole ENTER dressed for the
trail, longrider coats               and spurs. Saddlebags are slung over their
 shoulders.                                     JESSE                         E

ANK MANAGER steps out from behind his desk.
 MANAGER                         What are you talking about? The
          railroad's money is right over there                         in that

 wait               along both sides of the street in this medium sized
       mid-western town. Some are standing next to their horses,
some mounted.               ANOTHER ANGLE               An OLD MAN with a cane
is walking shakily towards the bank.               Frank jerks his head and Jim
 intercepts him.                                     JIM
  Hold on there, sir. Bank's closed                         today.

                  JIM                         Bank holiday! Bank's closed!
          Jim tries to steer the old man away. The old man starts
 batting at him with the cane.                                     OLD MAN
                    Get off me!                                     JIM

 don't want her to see me shoot                         this man.
 The woman covers the child's eyes. Cole raises the shotgun.               Jess
e half covers his eyes and turns his head. The Manager               swallows.
              EXT. FIDELITY BANK               Comanche Tom walks over to where
 the old man is still               SMACKING Jim and Bob.

       The old man settles against the wall. Comanche Tom moves               b

             INT. SHERRIFF'S OFFICE               A lean, middle-aged SHERRIFF
is walking by his window. His               DEPUTY is whittling at the desk. Th

talk...               BANG! The gang flinches as a chunk of wood splinters from
 a               post. They turn to see the Sherriff running out in front of
            them, raising his rifle --               The entire Gang draws thei
r guns. Jesse raises a hand.                                     JESSE
                Sir, you can do this the smart way,                         or
the stupid way. Only one way ends                         with you still breath
in'.               The Sherriff takes in the Gang's firepower. He lowers the
            rifle.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)
                     (to the Gang)                         Just 'cause we're ro
bbing a bank,                         no reason not to be civil about it.
         The Gang turns and RIDES OFF hard.               The DEPUTY walks up t

        A bonfire burns in the middle of a rough camp in the woods.
   The Gang members are sitting around, relaxing and drinking               cof
fee. All eyes are on Jesse and Cole as they finish               counting the m

CHEER again.                                     JESSE
All right, settle down. All this                         money ain't ours.

 was the bank's.                         That's why we had to go to all that

 think about this. We                         create some good will with the fo

yeah it does.                                     COLE
You stay out of this, Bob.                                     JIM
            I think Jesse's got a good idea --
    COLE                         You stay out of this too, Jim.
              (to Jesse)                         Who put you in charge of this
gang,                         anyway, Jesse? I did mighty fine
        leading us during the War.                                     JESSE
                      And I planned getting you off the
 hangman's deck --                                     FRANK
      And that's why you both lead the                         gang. Two of you
 went into that bank                         together, right?               Jes
se and Cole nod, still watching each other.
 FRANK  (CONT'D)                         Two heads are better than one. All
                     Jesse was doing was making a                         sugge
stion.               Jesse nods, his face giving nothing up.
                  FRANK  (CONT'D)                         So we're waiting to h
ear what you                         think of the suggestion. As the
              other leader of the gang.               Cole considers this.
                                COLE                         I reckon it's the
smart thing to do.               The other Gang members grumble. Cole whirls on
 them.                                     COLE  (CONT'D)
   Hey! We decide something, that's                         it! We're in this f
or the long haul,                         and this idea of me and Jesse's will

        The Gang LAUGHS, and the tension is broken. Jesse and Cole

And I do so want to shoot some                         Pinkerton detectives.
            Jesse and Cole grin and slap each other on the back. Jim
    BURSTS in waving a newspaper. He quickly runs to the bar.

            IN a richly paneled conference room, a group of BANKERS,
    POLITICIANS and RAILROAD OFFICIALS are gathered around a               larg
e table. On the table is a map with a dozen red markers.               Thaddeus
 Rains and Alan Pinkerton are studying the map.

     Gang as heroes against the Eastern                         businessmen. Th
is is not an area                         where men in suits are much loved.
                                  RAINS                         Pinkerton, why
can't you get these                         outlaws?
          PINKERTON                         It's early in the game yet, Mr.
                     Rains. Jesse James and I are just
learning how each other moves,                         feeling out each other's
 patterns.                                     RAINS                         I'

               PINKERTON                         Hardly farmers. I've done some
                         checking. All these were in the War.
       These men know sabotage, tactics,                         and have four
years of bloody                         fighting experience behind them.
                  They are disciplined, well-trained                         an

              create.                                     RAINS

months.                         I see robberies. I see hold ups. But
              I do not see men on the end of                         nooses.

ement                         who, quite frankly, are no match for
            this group's cunning.                                     PARKER
                      What about your detectives? They
haven't --               Pinkerton suddenly CLOSES on Rains and Parker. Rains
             doesn't back down, but we are acutely aware of the fact that
         Alan Pinkerton is a big, violent Scotsman. He never raises
   his voice here, but then again -- he doesn't have to.
              PINKERTON                              (to Parker)
          First of all: you, shut up.                              (to Rains)
                       Now, you've given me a thousand
miles of railroad to cover. Every                         time the James Gang s
trikes, we                         shift a hundred detectives to that
               area. But there's just too much open                         lan
d, too many riverbeds to ride,                         caves to hide in. This g
ang operates                         across four states, often riding a
                 hundred miles between jobs.
  RAINS                         I can't believe this.
           PINKERTON                         And there are some towns in

walk openly, as heroes.                                     PARKER

                    They donate money to farmers, to                         ch

          locals back to our side.                                     RAINS

You know how                         crazy I get!               Jesse and Cole
turn to the HEAD TELLER.                                     JESSE
            'Scuse us.                                     HEAD TELLER
                Think nothing of it.               Jesse and Cole cross to Bob.
                                     COLE                         We got a prob
lem here, brother?                                     BOB
         (low)                         Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little
                   left out.                                     JESSE
                     (sighing)                         This is about the "Wante
d!"                         Posters, isn't it.
    BOB                         Yes. I am obviously not standing
          out in people's minds at the                         robberies.
                               COLE                              (to Jesse)
                     This is your fault for hogging all
 the publicity.                                     JESSE
   Hold on, hold on, we all know Bob                         is an important pa
rt of the gang.               Frank arrives.
  FRANK                         Gents, we are in the middle of
        something here.                                     JESSE
           Bob's upset.                                     FRANK
           The posters?                                     JESSE/COLE
                Yeah.                                     BOB
       Don't say "yeah" in that voice.                         This is importan
t.               Frank, Jesse, and Cole exchange looks. They turn back to
         the now puzzled crowd.                                     FRANK
                   Pardon the delay, folks, but we had
to get Mad Bob Younger under control!                                     JESSE
                         Bob here'll kill a man for                         sne
ezing, and he's the best shot in                         the gang.
                        HEAD TELLER                         Better than you, Je
sse?                                     JESSE                         Bob Youn
ger taught me how to shoot!               The crowd MURMURS APPRECIATIVELY.
                                 FRANK                         Now, we would li
ke to get back to                         the robbery.
            HEAD TELLER                         Of course.               The He
ad Teller starts filling a saddlebag with money. Bob               glares at a
few people, then nods at Jesse. Jesse winks back.
                                 DISSOLVE TO:               INT. SALOON - NIGHT
               The place is alive with song, gambling, and the money the
        James Gang is dropping. At one table, Loni Packwood lays
down his poker hand. As the other players moan, he rakes in               the p
ot.                                     CLELL                         Damn, Lon
i, you're lucky.                                     LONI
   Luckiest man in the West, now that                         I'm riding with J
esse James!               He raises his lucky rabbit's foot in toast to Jesse,
who is               at the bar nursing a bottle of whisky with Frank.
      ANGLE ON               Jesse and Frank at the bar.
              JESSE                         This has been a good year.
                            FRANK                         Jesse, we're outlaws.
                                     JESSE                         And we're go
od at it.                                     FRANK                         It
got to you, didn't it. All the                         killing in the war. You
need it now.                                     JESSE
You've killed your fair share of                         men.
                   FRANK                         If I could go back to farming
--                                     JESSE                         That's a l
ie. You could've bought a                         dozen farms with the money we
've                         stolen.                                     FRANK
                       I can't quit and leave you alone. I
    can't quit until you quit. Ma                         would've wanted it th
at way.                                     JESSE                         We're
 doing this for Ma.                                     FRANK
       Maybe it started out that way. But                         now...
                              JESSE                         What do you want me
 to say, Frank?                         I was killing men when I was
              fifteen. I like getting shot at. I                         like r
iding out of town with a posse                         at my back. This is a he
lluva better                         life than farming.
             FRANK                         A better life than the one you
                   could have had with Zee?               Jesse HURLS the whisk
y bottle against the wall. At the               CRASH the saloon falls silent.
Every eye turns to the James               boys. Frank stands up.
                       FRANK  (CONT'D)                         I'll bet you eve
ry dollar we've                         stolen that she hasn't read a single
                      one of the letters you've sent her.               Jesse i
s boiling. His hand twitches.                                     FRANK  (CONT'
D)                         You going to throw down on me,
   Jesse?               Jesse's jaw is grinding.
      JESSE                         Don't do this, Frank. You know I
              love you.               Frank nods, embraces his brother. The sal
oon noise STARTS               UP again. Frank steps away.
                FRANK                         We're drunk.
                JESSE                         Oh yeah.
            FRANK                         Just do me a favor. Think about
                   what this is costing everybody. Not
just the railroad.               Jesse nods and Frank EXITS. Jim Younger, also
drunk, steps               up.                                     JIM
                You okay, Jesse?                                     JESSE
                    Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky?
 You're too young to be drinking                         whisky.
                      JIM                         Not too young to shoot a man,
 not                         to young to drink.
     JESSE                              (jolted)                         I gues
s so.                                     JIM                         I was alw
ays jealous Web Mimms got                         to go off and fight with you
and                         Cole. Now it's my turn.               Jesse takes t
his in silently.                                     JESSE
    Jim, you been with a girl yet?                                     JIM
                    Tonight? Why, I'm just getting                         read
y to turn on the Younger charm.               Jesse raises an eyebrow.
                            JIM  (CONT'D)                         Well, not exa
ctly.                                     JESSE                         You bee
n with a girl ever?                                     JIM
          (insulted)                         Hell yeah! I been with...
                     (sighs)                         Uh, not exactly. It's just
, I don't                         want to get one of these paid
         ladies, you know?                                     JESSE
              I think so.                                     JIM
           You and Frank and Cole, and even                         Bob, get al
l these girls because                         you're good looking and famous. Y
ou                         don't have to pay. They just look at
         me like I'm the baby brother.                              (then)
                    Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?
        JESSE                         I swear.
    JIM                              (whispering)                         Tell
you something else.                              (belches)
    I can't drink that good neither.                         I'm going to go ou
tside and throw up.                                     JESSE
       You do that.               Jim stumbles away and OUT THE DOOR. We hear h
im THROWING UP               ENERGETICALLY a moment later. Jesse thinks for a m
oment,               beckons over the bartender.               INT. SALOON - A
FEW MINUTES LATER               Jim stumbles back in. A pretty young woman, LYL
A,               approaches him.                                     LYLA
                   Excuse me. Are you Jim Younger?               Jim pulls hims
elf together.                                     JIM                         W
hy, yeah.                                     LYLA                         I ho
pe you don't mind, Jesse James                         told me your name.
                               JIM                              (crestfallen)
                       Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
           LYLA                         Yes, but just so I could find out
                   who you were.               Jim brightens.
                   JIM                         Really?
            LYLA                         I hope I'm not being too forward.
                                JIM                         Not at all.
                             LYLA                         I just though you wer
e awful cute.                                     JIM                         T
hank you, Miss -- ?                                     LYLA
      Lyla Devereux.                                     JIM
      Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you                         a drink?
                                LYLA                         Could we go upstai
rs and talk? It's                         so loud down here.
                  JIM                              (trying to stay
                 smooth)                         Why don't we get a bottle of s
herry                         to sip while we talk?
         LYLA                         That is so gentlemanly of you.
    As they head to the bar, WE SEE Jesse slide some money to               the
 bartender.                                     JIM
  (crossing)                         Devereux. My brother Cole dated a
                European girl once.                                     LYLA
                      Really?                                     JIM
               Don't talk about it much, though.               INT. CONFERENCE
ROOM               Parker is leading Rains into the room. Rains SNAPS SHUT his
              ever-present Pocketwatch.                                     PAR
KER                         The final route for the railroad is
         complete.                                     RAINS
      I look forward to seeing it.               A group of RAILROAD MEN wait a
round, wearing forced smiles.               Parker shows Rains the map.
       REVEAL the wall-sized map of the United States. The plainly
  marked RAIL LINE extends due west from New York, through               Philad
elphia, a straight shot west --               -- until it reaches Missouri, whe
re it takes a painfully               obvious swing in a large semi-circle sout
h of the state,               then swings up again and continues due west.
          Rains takes this in. Parker and the railroad men are trying
     to look casual.                                     RAINS  (CONT'D)
                  Parker.                                     PARKER
              Sir?                                     RAINS
      What is that?                                     PARKER
        What, sir?               Suddenly, viciously, Rains GRABS PARKER BY THE
 NECK and               SLAMS his face against the map.
             RAINS                              (calmly)
  That.                                     PARKER
 (strangled)                         Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
        Rains drops Parker, who slides to the floor stunned. He               t
urns to JENKINS, who is suddenly in an open area cleared by               the r

      It's cheaper to go around Jesse                         James, sir. Even
with the detour and                         the extra track. It's just cheaper.

             Every three months, the James Gang                         circles
 back to the vicinity of                         Liberty, Missouri. They always
 pull                         a job right before they return,
       probably to have extra money to give                         family and

                     What will be?               Jesse and Frank step from the
shadows. Cole tosses them a               newspaper.
          COLE                         Hyperion Bank, two day's ride from

                    FRANK                         Cole, he didn't mean that.

   COLE                         So being with me is being against
           you? Well, we don't want to do that!                         None of

                          COLE                         Now the one time one of
us comes up                         with an idea --
         JESSE                         A bad idea.
        COLE                         I got us through the War all right.
                              JESSE                         And almost got hang

   That's it.               Cole LUNGES for Jesse, and in a flash they're
         streetfighting, all elbows and knees and rib punches,               GR
UNTING and SWEARING. Frank and Bob try to break it up, but               it's t
oo fierce.                                     COMANCHE TOM
     Let them fight it out. The poison                         needs to leave t
he wound, to heal.               Jesse lands a ROUNDHOUSE, knocking Cole away.
Cole goes for               his gun, and in a blur they've both DRAWN and stand
 facing               each other with cocked six-guns. The Gang watches in stun

   Boys, we don't want this.               Neither Jesse nor Cole will back dow

                COLE                              (gritted teeth)

       come West again.               Jesse's gaze slides to Jim.
                       JESSE                         What about that Rock Islan

 his money.  He's putting up                         the payroll out of his own
 fortune.                         You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains,
               don't you Jesse?               Jesse and Cole stare at each othe

  Then let me run the show, General                         Lee.
Jesse thumbs down the hammer of his Colt. Cole does the               same. The
 entire Gang breathes out as one.                                     JESSE
                     Fine. We hit this bank.

ANK - DAY               The James Gang rides up to the bank. A WATER TOWER can

manche Tom, Jim Younger, Clell Miller and Loni               Packwood dismount

their horses, looking sharp.               ANGLE ON               Cole holds up

a dozen men APPEARING at the edge of the               opposite rooftop, aiming
 rifles...               Loni lets his rabbit's foot drop...               The
FIRST GUNSHOTS PLOW INTO LONI! As he falls back, we see               the rabbi

he --               JESSE'S POV in a mirror by the door reveals all twelve of
             the men in the bank drawing guns, shotguns, one rifle --
     Jesse shoves Cole and Frank down. He KICKS a stool at the               ma
n with the rifle, dives right and ROLLS across a big oak               desk. Th
e men begin to FIRE. As BULLETS PING around him,               Jesse FIRES from
 between his legs as he rolls across the               desk. The assassins star
t to drop.               Jesse completes his roll at a railing separating the
             manager's area from the bank floor. In one smooth move he's
        up and RUNNING ALONG THE RAILING, defying gravity, drawing
  his shoulder Colts and shooting...               The gunmen are crossing into
 each other's line of fire,               Jesse's movement confusing them. Jess
e's killed another               five, only four left, but he's out of railing
and --               CRASH! Through a teller's cage, disappearing behind the
            counter. The gunmen turn and BLAST the wooden counter, some
       screaming in panic.  CLICKS are heard as hammers fall on               e
mpty magazines.               The gunmen stare at where Jesse disappeared, pant
ing               heavily.               CLICK.               They forgot about
 Cole and Frank.               EXT. HYPERION BANK               The Gang is scr

oot lying in a pool of his blood. The               Gang is returning fire, hid
ing behind water troughs, dead               horses, barely staying alive. The
ROAR OF GUNFIRE is               deafening.

                   COLE                         They gonna rush us?

n case we                         run.               Jesse crosses to the front
 door.               EXT. HYPERION BANK               Jesse sticks his head out
 the door.                                     JESSE                         Ge
t inside, you --               Gunfire chews up the doorframe. Jesse pulls back
 inside.               INT. HYPERION BANK               Frank and Cole are shoo
ting through the windows.                                     JESSE
             They're all pinned down. Can't even                         get to
 the door.                                     FRANK                         Go
t any ideas, little brother?               Jesse thinks, then smiles.
                           FRANK  (CONT'D)                         Oh Lord.
           EXT. HYPERION BANK               Jesse comes CRASHING through a wind
ow! He rolls to a stop               next to one of the horses, grabs a saddleb
ag, then -- to the               disbelief of the Gang -- he pivots and CRASHES
 right back               into the Bank!               INT. HYPERION BANK
         Jesse stumbles to his feet, yanks open the bag. Sticks of
  dynamite tumble out.                                     FRANK/COLE
               Oh Lord.               EXT. HYPERION BANK               WE PAN a
cross the trapped Gang, still under fire, to the               front of the nex

ry patrons have taken cover from the gunfire.               Suddenly --
       BOOOM! One wall EXPLODES into dust! In the hole we see the
 interior of the Bank and --               Jesse James running through, already
 readying another stick               of dynamite --               EXT. ROOFTOP
               Where the Pinkerton gunmen are shooting at the Gang. Some
        of the gunmen look curiously as the windows to the building
   two doors down from the bank BLOW OUT.               EXT. STREET
   As the two Pinkerton detectives at the wagon barricade turn               in
 shock as Jesse James LEAPS FROM THE SECOND FLOOR of a               building h
e can't possibly be in, lands on the wagon, rolls               off and DASHES
INTO a blacksmith shop across the street.               They suddenly notice a
HISS. They stand, look in the wagon.               Jesse left a burning stick o
f dynamite in the wagon.               ANGLE ON               the wagon EXPLODI
NG into matchsticks.               INT. BLACKSMITH SHOP               The black
smith is gone, but there's a fire in the FORGE.               Jesse leaps and K
ICKS OVER the forge --               ANGLE ON               The white-hot coals
 IGNITING everything.               EXT. ROOFTOP               The Pinkertons f
iring on the gang notice SMOKE rising from               below them. They look
down ...               REVEAL bellowing FLAMES and SMOKE enveloping the entire
row               of buildings below them.               BACK TO
The roof as a PINKERTON COMMANDER runs to ledge and looks               at the
rising flames himself.               A HUGE EXPLOSION is heard O.C. A large SHA
DOW creeps over               the snipers. They turn and look up --
   -- at the Water Tower TOPPLING towards them!               The Pinkertons di
ve out of the way as the tower SMASHES               onto the roof, unleashing
a TIDAL WAVE of water!               EXT. STREET               UPSHOT of the sn
iper's ledge as the Pinkertons leap off,               followed by a WALL OF WA
TER --               WIDEN to see the water POURING into the building from abov

NTS of water               --               One Pinkerton SWEPT UP and carried
off the roof, BOUNCES               off a second floor balcony and lands in a p
uddle on the dirt               street below.               FOLLOW the water ru

 HYPERION BANK               Jim, Tom and the Gang staring in disbelief at the
total               destruction Jesse has wrought.               EXT. STREET
            Jesse rides out from a stable leading a team of horses. He
      reaches the bank.                                     JESSE
           No time to gawk, boys, we got                         somewhere else
 to be!               Frank and Cole rush out from the bank. The Gang leaps ont
o               the horses and put the spurs to them hard.               ANGLE
ON               the Gang galloping past the shattered wagon barricade,
       heading for the edge of town.               Pinkerton riflemen run out o
f the bank and from behind the               other barricade. One SHARPSHOOTER
with a rifle drops to one               knee, lines up...               HIS POV
 shows Jesse in his sights. He tightens on the               trigger, and just
as he pulls --               -- Jim Younger rides into the line of fire! With a
 CRACK               the bullet hits Jim square in the back. He slumps forward
on               his horse. Comanche Tom leaps from his horse onto Jim's and
            urges it on.               ANGLE ON               The James Gang di
sappearing past the edge of town. The               Pinkertons stand stunned am
ongst the ruin of their ambush.               Alan Pinkerton himself walks up,
shaking his head.               EXT. HILL COUNTRY - EVENING               The G
ang rides up onto a wooded hill where huge rocks jut               from the ear
th. They all dismount, Jesse and Cole supporting               Jim's limp form
as they pull him from the saddle. Jim is               drenched in blood.
                               JESSE                         Okay, you're gonna
 rest here.                                     COLE                         Cl
ell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in                         Liberty!
                    CLELL                         That's a long ride, Cole. We
won't                         be back 'til morning.
         JESSE                         Then you better get going!
 Cole and Jesse are united again in their grief over Jim.
               COLE                         Bob, rip up some bandages.
                            JESSE                         Pass me some whisky.
              Jim's eyes flutter open for the first time.
               JIM                         ... too young for whisky...
                            JESSE                         This time we'll make
an exception.                                     JIM                         J

 time...                                     JESSE                         You'
re gonna tell her when you're                         resting up in bed with he

 I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.                                     JIM
           Best time of my life.                              (weakly)
                I was famous, y'know...               Jim dies. Cole cradles th
e body, begins rocking. Comanche               Tom puts a hand on Bob's shoulde
r as Bob slumps against a               rock.               Jesse stands, walks
 away heavily.               EXT. HILLTOP - A WHILE LATER               Sunset
is heavy in the sky. Jesse stares off at it. His               anguish is palpa
ble. Frank comes over.                                     JESSE
          Shoulda learned with Web. Made it                         look fun, m
ade it look like an                         adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim.
                                     FRANK                         Jim was old
enough...                                     JESSE
  (snorts)                         He was a boy riding with the most
              famous outlaws in the West. How was                         he su
pposed to say no to that?                                     FRANK
             Railroad burned him out too. You                         couldn't
have stopped him.                                     JESSE
     You're a piss-poor liar for the                         smartest man I kno
w.                                     FRANK                         Yeah.
                                JESSE                         A war against the
 railroad. What                         the hell were we thinking?
                        FRANK                         I'm sure it seemed like a
 good idea                         at the time.               Jesse remembers t
he first time Frank said that. He crosses               BACK TO               t
he Gang.               ANGLE ON               the Gang -- what's left of them -
- waiting by the horses.               The unspoken knowledge of whose fault th
is is hangs in the               air.               Cole is covered in Jim's bl
ood.                                     COLE                         We'll mak
e them pay for this.                                     JESSE
        I'm out.                                     COLE
   WHAT?! We follow you for a year,                         and now that our bl
ood's been                         spilled, you're gonna quit?!
                     JESSE                         Who's next? You? Me? Bob?
            Cole can't answer.                                     CLELL
                  We can't exactly go back to our                         lives
, Jesse.                                     JESSE                         I'm
not telling you what to do. You                         want to keep on followi
ng Cole, fine                         by me.
  BOB                         Frank?               Frank nods. He's leaving too
.                                     COLE                         Go ahead. Ri
de on. But don't come                         back when you figure out you can'
t                         farm with a six-gun.               Bob embraces Frank
. Jesse goes to shake hands with Cole,               but the guilt and rage mak
e his once-best friend               unapproachable. Jesse smiles sadly and wal
ks away.               EXT. MIMMS HOME - EARLY MORNING               Zee is let
ting a dog out. She looks up, freezes. Entranced,               she walks out o
nto the porch.               ANGLE ON               A figure appearing out of t
he early morning fog. It's               Jesse, riding slow. He reins his horse
 in at the porch,               dismounts. He stands staring at Zee.
                          JESSE                         Zee.
                  ZEE                         Jesse. What are you thinking? The
re                         are bounty hunters and lawmen all
      over this county!                                     JESSE
           I had to see you. I'm getting                         married.
         Zee is shocked. Jesse looks serious.
   ZEE                         I don't understand.
        JESSE                         She's the most wonderful woman in
                 the world. Can't get her out of my                         min

nderful. It's just... I                         thought...
                JESSE                         She's beautiful. Smart. And has t
he                         biggest... buck teeth in all of
    Missouri.               It takes Zee a second. Before she can process it al
l, Jesse               drops to one knee.                                     J
ESSE  (CONT'D)                         I've quit my outlaw ways. Come live
                    in my home and in my heart.               Zee takes the hat
 off Jesse's head, tosses it into the yard               and smiles. Jesse stan
ds up and they kiss.

              Jesse and Zee ride in the back of the open carriage. They
       can't take their eyes off each other.
  ZEE                         I would never have imagined us in a
           place like this.                                     JESSE
               That's why I picked it. We can                         start a w
hole new life down here.                                     ZEE
          Are you going to be happy here, Mr.                         James? Wi
thout all that excitement?                                     JESSE
              I've got you. You keep me busy. I                         figure
we'll get over to the                         hotel... get checked in, cleaned
                        up... then I'd like to do something
     I've been thinking about for a long                         time.
                            ZEE                         Now wait a minute. Ther
e are                         certain things that have to wait
        until after the wedding.               Jesse leans forward to the DRIVE

                           DRIVER                         What religion?
                              JESSE                         Whichever one has G

TOR                         This is unusual. Most of our
  marriages are members of the                         congregation.
                          JESSE                         You don't think God'll
mind, do you?               Jesse slides him two twenties with the license.

Jesse James?                         The Jesse James?

ESSE                         No, that one was close. A couple
       fellas quit after that one.                                     PINKERTO
N                         Oh. That's nice to know.
 (then)                         We're going to hang you, you know.
                        JESSE                         I figured.
                      PINKERTON                         Was it worth it?
                              JESSE                         Should have just ki
lled Thaddeus                         Rains and been done with it.
                        PINKERTON                         That's what I would h
ave done.                                     JESSE                         I'm
 not hanged yet.                                     PINKERTON
             (shaking his head)                         You cocky little bastar
d.                                     JESSE                         Ahh, you'l
l miss me.                                     PINKERTON
  No, I'll hang you.                              (then)
  But I may miss you just a bit.               As Jesse and Pinkerton smoke and
 discuss the past year...               EXT. TRAINYARD               Two guards
 are leading Jesse, who is in heavy arm irons,               toward a prison ca
r at the end of a waiting train.               Pinkerton, Thaddeus Rains, and P
arker walk up.                                     RAINS
  This is him.                                     PARKER
   I remember you.                                     JESSE
      You're Parker. I remember you, too.                         You killed my
 Ma.               Parker is set back by Jesse's voice. To cover his fear --
                                  PARKER                         How did you kn
ow?                                     RAINS                         Not such
a menace now, is he,                         Pinkerton?
             PINKERTON                         If you feel that way, I could
                      always take off the irons.               Rains glares at
Pinkerton, then turns back to Jesse.                                     RAINS
                        You stole thousands. You cost me
  tens of millions of dollars, months                         of lost construct
ion. I wish I could                         hang you every single morning for a
                         century.               Rains checks his Pocketwatch, s
pots Jesse eyeing it.                                     RAINS  (CONT'D)
                   You like that? Solid gold, my                         father
 had it made when he started                         this railroad. He gave it
to me when                         I took over, I'll give it to my son
                when he runs this company, and he'll                         gi
ve it to his son -- The right type                         of men will always r
un this country,                         Jesse James, and little men like you
                       will always suffer. You have stopped
     nothing.                                     JESSE
 Made you think twice about burning                         folks' homes down n
ow, didn't I?               Jesse winks.               With that Parker reaches
 back and SUCKER PUNCHES Jesse.               Rains gloats as Jesse gets his br
eath back.                                     RAINS                         We
'll speak again in Washington,                         you insect.
                        JESSE                         You're coming on the same
 train?               Rains involuntarily looks behind Jesse. Jesse cranes his
              head and spots a CLUB CAR at the front of the train, several
          cars away from his prison car. The other cars are packed
  with Pinkerton detectives.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D
)                         Well, tell you what. I'm going to
     have to pay you a visit.                                     RAINS
                 Big words.                                     JESSE
               It's a promise.               Everyone is a little shaken by the
 steel in Jesse's voice.               The guards DRAG JESSE OFF.
 INT. PRISON CAR               The guards turn Jesse over to a BURLY DETECTIVE.
 Pinkerton               enters just behind him. There are ten detectives in to
tal in               the car.                                     PINKERTON
                     Hook him up.               The Burly Detective brings Jess
e's arms above his head. He               loops Jesse's chain over a rail that
runs the length of the               car. Two other detectives walk Jesse down
the car, Jesse's               hands suspended over his head. Jesse can just ba
rely sit               down.                                     PINKERTON  (CO
NT'D)                         Now the guns.
 BURLY DETECTIVE                         I don't like it. We can handle him.
                                  PINKERTON                         In the ten
seconds we have been in                         this car, I have seen you get c
lose                         enough for Jesse James to grab your
          guns at least three times. And I                         assure you,
if he gets his hands on                         one of your guns, you are all,
and I                         mean all dead men.
      BURLY DETECTIVE                         He's chained up.
                    PINKERTON                         I'll put that on your tom
bstone.                         The guns.               Grumbling, the detectiv
es deposit their pistols in a box               near the front of the car. Pink
erton walks out.               The Burly Detective slides a Colt into his waist
band.               ANGLE ON               Jesse, alone, surrounded by ten Pink
erton guards. The train               LURCHES, and they're off.               E
XT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY               The prison train highballs through the wood
ed, rolling               hills. We see the engine, the coal car, a detective c
ar,               then the private salon car, two more cars of guards, and
          then the prison car.               INT. PRISON CAR               Five
 guards are playing poker. Five others are standing               along the len
gth of the car. Jesse looks at the gun box               waaay down the other e
nd of the car.               Things shift, and we (and Jesse) realize the train
 is going               downhill.                                     JESSE
                     Hey, fatty.               The Burly Detective looks up.
                                  BURLY DETECTIVE                         What?
                                     JESSE                         You, ya barr
el of pork lard. Here                         piggy piggy!               The de
tectives close on Jesse. Jesse stands as the Burly               Detective move
s right up on him.                                     BURLY DETECTIVE
                What you sayin' boy?                                     JESSE
                        I think I recognize you.
      BURLY DETECTIVE                         How?
        JESSE                         I think I saw you leavin' by the
                front door just as I was coming in                         the
back.               The other detectives try to hide grins.
                 BURLY DETECTIVE                         You shut up now, boy.
                                    JESSE                         No, really. Y
ou're wife said she                         needed some help, seeing as you wer
e                         so fat you couldn't find your --               Burly
Detectives BACKHANDS Jesse. Jesse spits blood and               grins.
                            JESSE  (CONT'D)                         Yeah, she s
aid you did that to her                         too.               Burly draws,
 points the gun right at Jesse's face. The               other detectives GASP.
 Jesse stares down the barrel, then               raises his eyes and speaks in
 a voice that is low and               terrifying.
        JESSE  (CONT'D)                         Y'know, I could do this without
 the                         gun, but it just makes things easier.
  SLAM as Jesse KICKS Burly in the crotch! The gun FIRES,               missing
 Jesse's head only because he jerks it like a               mongoose.
     Jesse BACKHANDS the detective with the heavy chain! The gun
drops right into Jesse's hands --               The guards are running for the
gun box --               Jesse flips the chain TIGHT, TUCKS UP and KICKS OFF fr
om               the back wall and SLIDES THE LENGTH OF THE RAIL over the
         detectives' heads! As he reaches the end he FIRES the gun,
   blowing open the gun box. Jesse then SHOOTS the rail's               ceiling
 strut, and then KICKS at the roof.               The rail WRENCHES FREE, dropp
ing Jesse to the floor. In a               blur he's up, reaching into the gun
box. He tosses one gun               INTO THE AIR, then FANS THE HAMMER of anot
her.               Half the guards drop, but the other half are right on top
            of him and nobody's that fast --               Jesse drops the spen
t gun, CATCHES the other gun in the               opposite hand and FANS THAT H
AMMER all in a single breath!               As the smoke clears, the last of th
e detectives falls with               a THUD.               EXT. TRAIN
      Jesse pops open the door to his car. He's improvised a               gunb
elt like his old one, holding six Colts. He's still               holding the c
hain from his restraints. Now that they're no               longer wrapped arou
nd Jesse, we see they're at least a few               yards long.
 INT. THIRD TROOP CAR               Some Pinkertons LOOK UP as a BANG sounds fr
om on top of the               car.               EXT. TRAIN               And
Jesse JUMPS OFF THE ROOF and --               CLANK as the chains -- fastened t
o the roof -- go taut and               Jesse is at window level and he's FIRIN
G AND FIRING into the               car!               INT. THIRD TROOP CAR
           Pinkertons falling, drawing their guns, not able to get a
    bead on Jesse because --               EXT. TRAIN               Jesse is ru
nning along the side of the car, supported by               the chain! Still sh
ooting, he reaches the end, KICKS UP and               is on the roof again.
            ANGLE ON               one Detective, barely alive, stumbling throu
gh the door,               opening the door to the next               INT. SECO
ND TROOP CAR               The detectives inside start as the wounded man falls
 into               the doorway.               EXT. TRAIN               Jesse l
ooks down and sees heavily armed Pinkertons coming               out of the doo
rway.                                     JESSE                         Shit.
             But there's no turning back and he jumps to the top of the
       EXT. SECOND TROOP CAR               Jesse's running and the Pinkertons s
tart SHOOTING THROUGH               the roof. Jesse miraculously is untouched,
almost to the               CLUB CAR...               INT. CLUB CAR
   Pinkerton is already moving as Parker and Thaddeus Rains               look

               Vengeance.               INT. FIRST TROOP CAR               Pink

                         Outside! Get up on top! Go GO!               EXT. CLUB
 CAR               Jesse JUMPS onto the club car, but pulls up short as
       detectives appear ahead of him. He turns to see other               dete
ctives climbing up behind him. He's trapped.               BUT WE HEAR A LOW WH
ISTLE AND               EXT. TRAIN ENGINE               The engine EXPLODES! Sp
arks fly as the twisted engine               GRINDS onto the tracks!
    EXT. TRAIN               The momentum carries everyone off their feet! Some
               detectives are torn from the train. Jesse slides across the
          roof of the Club Car --
                      CUT TO:               EXT. TRAIN TRACK               CLOS

T. TRAIN TRACK               Frank and Cole riding toward them. From the woods
ride               Comanche Tom and Bob Younger, folding into perfect
     formation. The four THUNDER toward the train.               INT. CLUB CAR
              Pinkerton rushes back in. Parker and Rains are looking out
        the window.                                     PARKER
        There's only four of them...                                     PINKER
TON                         Move you fools!               He grabs the two busi

T. TRAIN TRACK               Frank draws a gun and FIRES.               EXT. WO
ODS               TWO DOZEN RIDERS pour out of the woods, all firing at the
           Pinkerton! The Pinkertons return fire, taking shelter in the
       train cars as the riders strafe the train.               EXT. TRAIN
          Jesse swings over the edge of the train, looks through the
    window. Rains is gone. He turns and starts running back               along
 the top of the train.               EXT. PRISON CAR               Pinkerton, R
ains and Parker tumble out of the door and run               for the woods.
           Jesse LEAPS DOWN from the top of the train onto Pinkerton!
     They wrestle, separate. Pinkerton stands, reaching for his               g
unbelt.               Empty.               With almost a resigned sigh, he look
s up. Jesse's pointing               the gun at Pinkerton's head.
                       PINKERTON                         Do it.               J
esse FIRES.               ANGLE ON               Pinkerton, stunned to realize
he's still alive. He turns to               see Parker, fall to the ground, his
 own gun half-drawn,               Jesse turns the gun on Rains.
                      JESSE                         That was for my Ma. Now thi
s is for                         everybody else.
      PINKERTON                         He's too important, James.  They'll
                     set the army on you. You and your
wife.               Jesse stares at Rains, Rains stares back, the tension
         building...Jesse's about to shoot...and says:
            JESSE                         That is a nice watch you got there.
             Rains looks down at the fob, back up. The tension isn't
    broken.                                     JESSE  (CONT'D)
         I tell you what, I'll buy that                         watch from you,
 for the fair market                         price approved by the Department o
f                         the Interior: one dollar.               Rains hesitat
es. Jesse thumbs the hammer back                                     JESSE  (CO
NT'D)                         If I were you, I'd sell. After
      this, the price goes...down.               Rains tosses the Watch to Jess
e as Jesse simultaneously               FLIPS Rains a dollar coin with his free
 hand. Jesse holds up               the Watch.
    JESSE  (CONT'D)                         Now every time you go to look at
                      this watch and it's not there,                         yo
u'll remember: You can be stopped.                         Pass that down to yo
ur son, instead.               Jesse thumbs the hammer forwards, lowers the gun
. Rains               falls to his knees, numb from the tension.
Frank rides up. Jesse empties Pinkerton's gun and hands it               to him
. Pinkerton holds him for a second.                                     PINKERT
ON                              (low)                         Tennessee.
        Jesse doesn't understand.                                     PINKERTON
  (CONT'D)                         The railroad has no business in
            Tennessee. Therefore I have no                         interest in
the state of Tennessee.                                     JESSE
           Thanks.                                     PINKERTON
          I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse                         James. But c
hasing you takes up too                         much of my time.
                      JESSE                         Fair enough.
Zee RIDES UP. Jesse SWINGS UP onto her horse, and then they               RIDE
OFF with Frank.               We PULL UP AND AWAY, centering on Pinkerton, Rain
s, and               revealing the smoking, burning wreckage of the train.
          EXT. HILLSIDE FIELDS - DAY               Most of the Gang is mounted.
 Frank, Cole and Bob are               standing there, watching.
ANGLE ON               Jesse and Zee riding up on one horse.
                  ZEE                         You get arrested again, I'll kill
                         you.                                     JESSE
                 Yes ma'am.                                     ZEE
             I can't believe I had to blow up a                         train f
or you.                                     JESSE                         You a
re a hell of a woman.                                     ZEE
       Don't swear.                                     JESSE
       Yes ma'am.               They reach the Gang. Jesse SWINGS OFF his horse
, gets one               of Cole's BEAR HUGS.
   COLE                         Missed you, cousin.
         JESSE                         Missed you too, cousin.               Je
sse notices Cole is oddly emotional, but can't quite               figure out w
hat's going on.                                     COLE
  You know, you gettin' caught, right                         after leaving us,
 some people                         thought --
     JESSE                         Pff. All we been through, the
          thought never crossed my mind.               The two clasp hands.
                                 BOB                         Things changed whe
n you quit the                         gang. For example, I'm now the one
                   who says "Let's ride."                                     C
OLE                         He's not bad at it.
     BOB                         It's tougher than it looks.
                  JESSE                         Where'd you get all these rider
s?                                     COLE                         We didn't.
Zerelda did. Turns out                         your wife makes a hell of an out
law.                                     BOB                         So what's
the plan?               Jesse looks at Zerelda and Frank.
               JESSE                         I think my wife and I might go dow
n                         Tennessee way, buy a farm.
   (pause)                         Goodbye, boys.               The Youngers sm
ile sadly, but NOD. As the Younger brothers               SADDLE UP, Comanche T
om leans down from the saddle and               shakes Jesse's hand.
                          COMANCHE TOM                         You stay out of
trouble, Jesse.                         Nobody has as much luck as you used
                     up today.               ANGLE ON               Jesse getti
ng back on his horse with Zee. Frank stands               there and watches the
m.                                     FRANK                         I'll meet
you down there in a few                         weeks.
            JESSE                         See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate
                      the distraction back there.
       FRANK                         Hell, they hardly even noticed us.
       Jesse and Frank grin.                                     BOB
              Let's ride!               Jesse flips the reins and he and Zee RI
DE OFF, the GANG               with the Youngers RIDES OFF in the opposite dire
ction.               Frank watches them ride away. WE HEAR faintly:
                         ZEE                         Tennessee?
                     JESSE                         I'll explain on the way.
           Then it's Frank alone on the hill. WE CIRCLE around behind
     him, come around, see he's AGED a little, CIRCLE AGAIN and               n
ow he's AGED MORE, we come around one more time and...               EXT. HILLS
IDE NEAR LIBERTY - DAY - TWENTY YEARS LATER               ...we COMPLETE THE CI
RCLE and see young Frank James is now               an older FRANK JAMES. Still
 lean, a few wrinkles, a little               grey in the hair, dressed in expe
nsive turn-of-the-century               western clothes. A young man who looks
remarkably like               Jesse, JIMMY JAMES, 16 years old, is waiting pati
ently. The               two are looking down on the town of Liberty, Missouri,
 which               is now swollen five sizes larger. The Wild West is
       disappearing under roads and telegraph wire.
         JIMMY                         Y'know, Uncle Frank...
                   FRANK                         Yeah, Jimmy?

 few of                         the edges up.
   JIMMY                         Sounds like he was a hell of a man.

                  That he was.                                     JIMMY
                  They're making him a hero now.
      FRANK                         Saved a lot of folk from the
          railroad.                                     JIMMY
       But he killed a lot of men, too.                                     FRA

  JIMMY                         So what was he?
     FRANK                         I think... he was just a real
          interestin' fella to have around.               Frank chuckles again
at the memories, claps his hand on               Jimmy's shoulder.
