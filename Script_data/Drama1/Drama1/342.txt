               MADE               INT. SPORTSMAN'S LODGE - SAN FERNANDO VALLEY
- DAY               A large crowd has gathered to watch two WHITE BOXERS square
               off in a temporary ring in the center of a converted banquet
           hall. One is BOBBY, the other is RICKY. They are drawn
 together to start the bout by a bell and a hand gesture as               the R
EFEREE backs away. Immediately the two fighters unload               a relentle
ss barrage of POWER PUNCHES. Neither man is               holding back, and the
 punches all find purchase in the               swelling faces of their opponen
t. The crowd rises to its               feet in appreciation of this rare level
 of competition in               the lower strata of the heavyweight division.
                                                                   CUT TO:
          EXT. BOBBY'S CAR - COLDWATER CANYON - LOS ANGELES - SUNSET
    Bobby drives Ricky home through the winding twists of LA's               la
ndmark canyon. Both their faces are swollen, verging on               the grote
sque. Bobby drives a black Special Edition 1979               Trans Am with the
 gold Firebird stenciled across the hood.               The car is not in great
 shape, but in its day ruled the               road. A Hawaiian mini warrior ma
sk hangs from the rear view.               The T-top is out, and Ricky struggle
s to light his               cigarette in the wind. He finally ignites the whol
e book of               matches in frustration, lights up, then tosses it out.
              It lands, still flaming, at the base of a 'No Smoking in
      the Canyon' sign. They drive down the palm tree lined               stret
ch of road bordering Beverly Hills. They turn East on               Sunset Boul
evard. The Strip lights are first flickering to               life.
   EXT. RICKY'S APARTMENT - YUCCA CORRIDOR - NIGHT               The opening SC
ORE dies away as Ricky sits beside Bobby. The               neighborhood is awf
ul. The light of the corner liquor store               and a menthol cigarette
billboard make up for the broken               street lamps. Ricky smooths out
his running suit and steals               an instinctive cautionary look, scann
ing all the blind spots               for predators. The swelling has now truly
 set in. He's a               mess.                                     RICKY
                       Did Max mention anything about any
   jobs?                                     BOBBY                         What
 about boxing?                                     RICKY
  What about it?                                     BOBBY
    What are you saying?                                     RICKY
            You said if you didn't have a                         winning recor
d after eleven fights,                         you'd talk to Max.
                       BOBBY                         So?
              RICKY                         So, it was a draw.
                    BOBBY                         Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.
                            RICKY                         So, it's not a winnin
g record.                                     BOBBY                         It'
s not losing record.                                     RICKY
        That's not what you said. You said                         if you didn'
t have a winning record-                                     BOBBY
            Don't be shitty.                                     RICKY
                How am I being shitty?                                     BOBB
Y                         Don't be shitty.
RICKY                         I wouldn't keep bugging you, but
        you said he said he would have a job                         for us.
                                  BOBBY                         I'm not gonna b
ring it up to him.                                     RICKY
      Of course I don't want you to bring                         it up to him.
.. But if it comes up...                                     BOBBY
            I'll page you.                                     RICKY
              Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
       BOBBY                         Yeah. I know the number.
                   RICKY                         Cause if you don't know the nu
mber,                         I can page you with the number so
         you'll have the number.                                     BOBBY
                    I know the number.                                     RICK
Y                         I'll page you with the number. I'll
       see you later. What time you done?                                     B
OBBY                         I got no idea.
 RICKY                         Ask if he said anything to her.
                    BOBBY                         I will.
               RICKY                         I'll page you with the number.
                                 BOBBY                         Bye.
   He drives off. Ricky checks his pager, still furtively               scannin
g the street.               EXT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - BLACKBURN - LOS ANGELES - NI
GHT               Bobby pulls up in front of the quaint Spanish Colonial
        two-flat. He bounds up the stairs to the upper unit.               INT.
 JESSICA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS               He lets himself in, searching for h
is girlfriend. The               apartment is Z-Gallery, with a few accents of
Bobby's               HAWAIIANA.                                     BOBBY
                    Honey?                                     JESS (O.S.) (O.S
.)                         Where were you?               He finds her in the be
droom. JESSICA is a knockout. Too               pretty. The pretty that makes a
 woman a full-time job.               What's worse is she's decked out like a w
hore. She's wearing               slutty lingerie covered by a bland terry clot
h bathrobe. Her               ridiculously long legs are garnished with candy-a
pple porn               star sky high heels.  Bobby watches with cultivated pat
ience               as she applies tasteless amounts of make-up from a Mac case
               the size of a tackle box. She's in a hurry.
                BOBBY                              (swallowing utter
                   contempt)                         So, what kind of gig is th
is?                                     JESS                         Easy night
. Bachelor party. Can we                         give Wendy a ride?
                         BOBBY                         No. What kind of bachelo
r party?                                     JESS                         The e
asy kind. They're young and                         rich and well mannered.
           She turns to look at him and reacts to his horrifying
appearance.                                     JESS (continues) (CONT'D)
                   Oh my god. What happened?
  BOBBY                         A draw. What makes you think
      they're well mannered?                                     JESS
               Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a                         bunch
 of young agents and it's at a                         restaurant. It's gonna b
e easy and                         we'll make a lot of money.
                   BOBBY                         I don't like you working with
                        Wendy. Why are you working with
 Wendy?                                     JESS                         They r
equested her. It was her gig.                         Max put me on as a favor.
                                     BOBBY                         Some favor.
I hope they know you're                         not like Wendy.
                     JESS                         Oh, please.
                   BOBBY                         If they asked for her, they're
                         probably expecting blowjobs all
  around.                                     JESS                         Will
 you cut it out! Get ready,                         we're already late.
                             BOBBY                         Who's watching the b

           BOBBY                         I'm ready.
         JESS                         Bullshit. These are classy
          customers. You can't show up all                         fucked up wi
th a Fila running suit                         on.
        BOBBY                         They're not too classy to have tits
                   rubbed in their face.               She rises and swaps her
robe for a floor length overcoat.               God, is she hot.
                      JESS                         Stop. I love you.
    She leans in for a kiss. He lets his anger melt. He leans               in
to kiss her. She gives him last minute cheek to save the               perfecti
on of her sparkling twenty minute lips.                                     JES

Wendy is now being dry humped by two guys. Jessica looks               over at
her, and is concerned. Lines of protocol are               definitely being cro

cleavage.  In a split second, Bobby               has crossed the room and has
him by a wrist. The guy is               surprised by Bobby's presence and grot
esque appearance.                                     HORNY GUY

 away,               zipping the roll into his pocket. When he arrives at the
             bar, a drunk EXECUTIVE is having a quiet conversation with
       Horrace. Horrace looks around, answers, and the executive
picks quite a few hundreds out of his wallet. Horrace walks               him b
ack to Wendy. Bobby grinds his teeth and points to his               empty glas
s. The bartender pours and watches the interaction               as Wendy walks
 off with the executive. The party howls as               they leave the room f
or some privacy.                                     BARTENDER

    Bobby downs another drink. Things are now heating up for               Jess
 as mob mentality takes hold. She squirms. We TRACK BACK               with Bob

                   a rubber-               Bobby cracks his face apart with an
uppercut. Another guy               rises in protest and is on his ass with a b
roken nose before               he can speak.
   JESS                         God damn it...               Bobby drags his gi

 Wendy, who is doing coke off a               mirror with her john. He drags th

           Shhh...               The DECORATOR walks in with a YOUNG COUPLE and
 their six               year old KID. The decorator is irritating. The husband
 is a               shlubby Jew. His wife is a hot shiksa.               The ki

  And as you can see, we're a little                         behind in here. We
 always knew the                         kitchen would be the trouble spot.

                        want Christmas in the new house.

                         trades are stacking a bit. But look
      at this Italian plaster job. The                         color skim-coat
will go on next.                                     WIFE
   It looks great.               Ricky sneaks some eye contact to the wife. She
 almost               smiles as he peers at her with his battle scarred face. T
he               little boy pokes his finger into the wet plaster. Bobby
        throws him a look. The kid just stares back like he owns him.

         her beautician. Security seems quite lax.

                                            CUT TO:               INT. MAX'S OF
FICE - VAN NUYS - DAY               Bobby walks in. He doesn't seem like he's b
een there               before. The first thing that hits you is all the
        thoroughbred racing shit all over the place.  Brass table
 top statues, pictures of jockeys with wreaths,               hand-painted(!) p
ortraits of horses faces. The second thing               you notice is MAX REUB
EN. He's an off-the-rack East Coast               Jew.               He's got d
eep-set eyes and Abe Vigoda brows. He wears a               golf shirt with a l
ittle penguin on it, and oversized               reading glasses are perched on
 his balding head. His nose               was broken in '63. He smiles broadly
as Bobby enters. Bobby               forces a relaxed smile.
                  MAX                              (on phone)
       Will ya calm down. Just calm down                         for a minute,
Nadeleh. The money                         will be there. How do I know? I just
                         know... Yes. Yes, that's exactly
   what I'm saying... You got my word.               He hangs up his rotary pho
ne and looks up to Bobby, who               stands looking at the painting with
 his ears closed.                                     MAX (continues) (CONT'D)
                        You like the ponies?
  BOBBY                         Sure. Yeah.
 MAX                         You bet the ponies?
      BOBBY                         Me? No. Not really.
             MAX                         Smart. Hard as hell to handicap.
                   You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast
 game. You know why I like it?                                     BOBBY
                  Why?                                     MAX
        It's fixed. That's the only way to                         win. A sure
thing. See that horse.                         The blaze.
               BOBBY                         This one?
            MAX                         Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in
                  '66. Hired a trainer, stall,                         whatever
 it was. That horse made me                         over a hundred grand. In 's
ixties'                         dollars. You know what that is today?
                           BOBBY                         Pshhh...
                       MAX                         A million. Easy.
                         BOBBY                         She was fast, huh?
                               MAX                         Never won a race. Bu
t it got me in                         with the trainer. We'd have a thing,
                     I don't remember, some fucking                         thi
ng. The jockey would raise his                         whip, it meant the fix w
as in, we'd                         all go running. People get greedy.
                First they bet small, they keep                         their m
outh shut. Within a month's                         time, everyone and their br
other was                         in on it. The odds would drop, I
            mean you could watch the goddamn                         board. It
looked like a fuckin                         stopwatch, the odds would drop so
                        fast.                                     BOBBY
                 That's why they call it the smart                         mone
y.               Maxie laughs a genuine laugh.
    MAX                         I like you, kid. Why do you gotta
           make it so hard for me to take care                         of you?
                                    BOBBY                         Mr. Reuben, I
 swear to God, they                         were out of line.

sica like she's my                         own daughter.  I would kill anyone
                       so much as lays a finger on her or
   her beautiful daughter, but that                         fucking pisher you
socked in the                         mouth has the most expensive dentist
                    in Beverly Hills and wants I should
 buy him an implant. Your silverback                         horseshit's gonna
cost me eight                         grand.
  BOBBY                         I'll work it off.
       MAX                         Not driving Jess, you won't.
                     BOBBY                         What?
              MAX                         You're not driving Jess no more.
                    Two strikes, Bobby, and this last                         o
ne was big. The bachelor's father                         goes to my schul.
                                 BOBBY                         So, that's it. I

I don't understand.                                     MAX

 all over the love                         of your life, then I wonder why you
                        seered. It's my fault. The tooth is
     on me. But no more. I'm                         'reassigning' you.
                             BOBBY                         Don't want to drive

               I learned. If you can't cook, then                         you g
otta go out to eat every night,                         then you spend all your
 money on                         food. And when you eat in
     restaurants, the cooks scratch their                         ass and touch
 the food.               There's a knock on the door.

He's not fucking                         driving you!

BOBBY                         Max offered to stake me.
            JESS                         Yeah, well Max offers a lot of

 crosses to the door, abruptly ending the discussion.               Bobby grabs
 her.                                     BOBBY                         She nee

NT. MAX'S OFFICE - VAN NUYS - DAY               Max sits behind his desk as he

eveled               and torn. Ricky talks a steady stream of bullshit, but the
               DOORMAN will have none of it.

                 BOBBY                         What the fuck is that supposed-
                                    RICKY                         Mean, that's
what I heard-                                     BOBBY
 You got something to say-               Bobby grabs him, and is about to start
 another scrap, when               the distant roar of a fleet of JAPANESE SUPE
R BIKES draws               near. The pack screams up to the duo.
 There are a dozen black men, on Ninjas, and they all wear               black
Nazi-style helmets.               The two men freeze, and the bikes settle in a
round them.               One BIKER pulls up to Bobby.
            BIKER                         They flew you all the way out here
                      to cook me up some fuckin puttanesca?               Bobby
 recognizes the biker is Horrace, from LA. He is               relieved, but no
t pleased.                                     RICKY                         Yo
u know this guy?                                     BOBBY
    His names Horrace. Horrace, this is                         Ricky Slade.
                                  HORRACE                         What's up. Yo
u all ready to meet                         Ruiz?
       BOBBY                         Yeah. Where is he?               Horrace t
hrows him a helmet.
        CUT TO:               EXT. HARLEM STREETS - MANHATTAN - NIGHT
     Bobby now rides bitch behind Ho, and Ricky clutches the               back
 of a buff shirtless BROTHER. The bikes rip down the               uptown stree
ts with a ferocity that scares pedestrians. An               urban drum track r
attles the SOUNDTRACK.               EXT. LITTLE ITALY - MANHATTAN - NIGHT
          The horde of bikers rumble under a red, white, and green
  banner strung from street lamps marking the start of Italian               tu
rf. The businesses are all closed or closing.               Looks are drawn fro
m locals as the outsiders chug by at a               respectful trawl.
      EXT. LUNA RESTAURANT - LITTLE ITALY - NIGHT               The pack pulls
away leaving only Bobby, Ricky, and Horrace.               Ho leans his Ninja t
o rest next to a custom Buell               Harley-Davidson cafe racer.
       Bobby can't help but stare at the rare piece of machinery.
 They enter.               INT. LUNA RESTAURANT - LITTLE ITALY - CONTINUOUS
           The restaurant is now closed, but RUIZ sits in a rear booth
      on a Nokia. He is a slim, young black man with a tight round
  fro. He wears a rolex, but, other than that, nothing flashy.               He
's wearing dark Gucci slacks, a black pullover crew-neck               shirt, a
nd a black, red and orange racing leather jacket. He               must have pu
ll here, because 'Between the Sheets' is playing               over the stereo
of this bare-bones, Italian eatery.                                     RUIZ
                           (on cell)                         Nah, man. Nah. Too
 risky. I don't                         like it... I want out... It's too
                   risky... Listen, man, we made a lot
of money together on this one, but                         it's over. Shit's go
nna come down...                         Well, then, you got my blessing. I'm
                       selling my end. This internet shit's
     too volatile. I'll keep my block of                         Microsoft, but
 I'm taking profits on                         Yahoo and all the portal stocks.
 The                         bubble's gonna pop, man... Alright,
          peace.               The three men approach Ruiz's table.
                         RUIZ (continues) (CONT'D)                         That
's it? This is Maxie's cavalry?                         Who the fuck swole you

                What do I look like a fucking                         Persian t

 (firm)                         Hey. I'm half Lebanese.
             BOBBY                         We're with Ruiz.
                 DOORMAN                         Ruiz isn't here.
                       BOBBY                         We're supposed to meet him
 here. Is                         Ruiz on the list?
         DOORMAN                         Ruiz is always on the list. He just
                      ain't here, though.                                     B
OBBY                         Can you check?
 DOORMAN                         He's not here.               While they're wai
ting, the actor who played SCREECH on               'Saved By the Bell', now in
 his twenties, walks by and is               let through the rope with a handsh
ake.                                     DOORMAN (continues) (CONT'D)
               What's up, man.                                     SCREECH
                    S'up.                                     DOORMAN
               You look big, man. Diesel. You been                         lift

  Cool. See you later.                                     DOORMAN
            Cool.               Ricky can't believe his eyes.
                   RICKY                         Did you see that shit? Motherf

Screech?                                     DOORMAN                         He
's on the list.                                     RICKY
        (hot)                         Show me. Show me where it says
              Screech on the fucking list.               This altercation is cu
t short by the arrival of Ruiz and               Horrace. The Red Sea parts as
they approach the door.                                     DOORMAN
             What's up, bro? You look big, man,                         you bee
n lifting?                                     RUIZ                         A l
ittle. How's it going tonight?                                     DOORMAN
                    Shit's off the chain. These two say
 they're with you.                                     RUIZ
     Yeah.                                     DOORMAN
Alright. These two are good.               He opens the rope. Bobby shakes his
hand.                                     DOORMAN (continues) (CONT'D)
                Sorry, man, but...                                     BOBBY
                      Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
               DOORMAN                         Any time, bro.
                   BOBBY                         Thanks.               Ricky wa
lks by and throws him a look like he just stuck it               in.
    INT. SPA - 13TH STREET - CONTINUOUS               Bobby and Ricky are lead
into the club and past a window               and another set of ropes.
       Their hands are stamped several times representing the               hig
hest level of security clearance. They file down a               staircase and
into one common area where hip-hop plays and               people dance. Ruiz a
nd Horrace touch hands with an endless               stream of ACQUAINTANCES. T
hey pass a myriad of rooms and               seating areas, then down a narrow
corridor where they               encounter yet another DOORMAN who waves them
past a CLUMP of               VIP hopefuls. They trot down a short bank of stai
rs and               into...               INT. VIP AREA - SPA - CONTINUOUS
           ... a series of passageways furnished like a French parlor.
      Lithe MODELS sit amongst Dreadlocked white boys. After yet
another bar, the crowd vomits into a cavernous bomb shelter.               A pu
lsing dance floor is surrounded by a series of couches               and coffee
 tables, representing the private seating areas.               At the far end o
f the room is an elevated stage with a DJ               and a banner reading 'G
RANDMASTER FLASH'. The party is               greeted by a male club PROMOTER.
He hugs Ruiz. With the               slightest of nods, the party is lead to th
e prime table with               a table tent marked 'RESERVED.' They sit down
as a beautiful               MODEL/WAITRESS brings two buckets of champagne and
 fluted               glasses. Bobby and Ricky try to hide how impressed they a
re               as they look at each other. GIRLS on the dance floor throw
           priceless looks toward their table. Ricky raises a glass to
      one. Ruiz finally looks at them and leans in. He's spotted
someone.                                     RUIZ                         That'
s him. Now you all know the                         drill, right?
                       BOBBY                         What drill?
                      RICKY                         We don't know any drill. No
body                         told us anything.
    RUIZ                         Maxie told you to keep your mouth
            shut while you're working, right?
   BOBBY                         Yeah.                                     RICK
Y                         So we're working?
 RUIZ                         What the fuck you think, I wanna
        'hang' with you motherfuckers? Yeah                         you're work
ing. And put down the                         champagne.
              RICKY                         She poured it for-
                    RUIZ                         Far as she knows you're John G
otti.                         Now put the shit down and act like
          you got some ass.               Ruiz gets up and crosses to a BRITISH
 looking GUY across               the room. They watch.
             BOBBY                         He making the drop?
                    HORRACE                         Nah, man. He's just making
contact.                         That's our man. The Welsh guy.
                     BOBBY                         What's his name?
                         HORRACE                         Ruiz don't like using
names on cell                         phones. He refers to him as the Red
                   Dragon.                                     BOBBY
              So, when's the drop.                                     HORRACE
                        To be honest, man, I don't know
 shit either. All I know is it ain't                         drugs and it ain't
 now.                                     RICKY                         How do
you know it's not drugs?                                     HORRACE
              Maxie knows I don't go near drugs.                         I did
a minute in Quentin for                         possession with intent. And it
ain't                         now cause he woulda told me.
                RICKY                         You strapped?
                 HORRACE                              (confused)
          'Strapped?'                                     RICKY
         It means you got a gun?                                     HORRACE
                      I know what 'strapped' means,                         mot
herfucker. What the fuck you                         think this shit is? '21 Ju
mp Street?'                              (notices)                         Cool
 out, they're coming back. Just                         throw up your screw fac
e and don't                         speak unless spoken to.               They
settle in and Ruiz comes back with the WELSHMAN.               They're both lau
ghing.                                     RUIZ                         Here, m
an, sit down.                                     WELSHMAN
         (breaking the                              tension)
      I see you brought along the rogues                         gallery.
                               RUIZ                         Not really. Just so
me friends from                         out West. This is Ho, Bobby, and
                  Rick.               He shakes their hands, keeping it light.
                                    WELSHMAN                         And here I
 thought you flew in some                         out of town muscle. How's it
going,                         men?                                     RICKY
                       So, you must be the Red Dragon.               This draws
 GLARES from Ruiz, Ho, and especially Bobby.               After an uncomfortab
le pause, the Welshman breaks the               tension with laughter.
                            WELSHMAN                         Well, that's news
to me. The name's                         Tom.
    RICKY                         Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh,
      'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?                                     W
ELSHMAN                         Edinburgh.
RICKY                         And where might that be?
            WELSHMAN                         Scotland.
            RICKY                         Well, word on the street is you're
                      Welsh.                                     WELSHMAN
                   I am.                                     RICKY
            A rose by any other name would--
  RUIZ                              (changing the
subject)                         Come here, there's someone I want
            you to meet. You like big tiddies?
    WELSHMAN                         Well, who doesn't?               They walk
 off. Ruiz sneaks a glare.
               CUT TO:               INT. LIMOSINE - IN FRONT OF SPA - 13TH STR
EET - NIGHT               Ricky and Bobby are being lectured by Ruiz, who sits
across               from them next to Horrace.
     RUIZ                         What the fuck was you told? Don't
             talk, right?                                     RICKY
             Unless spoken to, ain't that right,                         Horrac
e. Didn't you say that?                                     HORRACE
             Don't drag my ass into this-                                     R
ICKY                         He spoke to me. You want me to dis
         him?                                     RUIZ
'Dis?' 'Dis?' You're not in a                         position to 'dis', or 'gi
ve props',                         or whatever your Real World sense of
                 fucking decorum tells you to do.                         You'r
e nothing. You're wallpaper.                         You're not here to make fu
cking                         friends. Asking a motherfucker where
            he lives. And who the fuck told you                         'Red Dr
agon'?.                                     BOBBY                         We ge
t it. We're sorry.                                     RUIZ
     Now that Limey motherfucker's jumpy                         and wants to c
hange shit around on                         me. Maxie's gonna shit a Nokia whe
n                         he hears about... Aw, shit, I better
        call him before he hears.               Ruiz pulls out his cell phone a
nd steps out, slamming the               door.
    HORRACE                         I'm not saying shit to neither of
               you.                                     RICKY
       Why? What I say bad?                                     HORRACE
                 What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
   RICKY                         What? Why am I bad?
          BOBBY                         How bad is it?
            HORRACE                         It's bad. Before you even showed
                      up, he said you were Maxie's 'token
   goons', and not to be trusted. He                         wanted to TCB alon
e. I was gonna                         ride shotgun to keep the English
                 dude above board. Now he's spooked.                         Th

          When's it going down?                                     HORRACE
                     Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now,
  who knows?                                     BOBBY
Shit.               Outside, Ruiz starts his bike. Horrace slides out.
                            HORRACE                         See you later.
                                RICKY                         You really in tro

                 BOBBY                         You can't go in there. They know
                         you're with Ruiz.
RICKY                         You got that right.

         The place is a mess. Room service is all over the place.
 Bianca, Cynthia, the Asian coat check girl, and Bobby sit               in the
 squalid living area as Ricky enters from the toilet               zipping his
fly.                                     RICKY                         I don't
know about you guys, but                         I'm starting to feel a really
sexual                         vibe here.                                     B
IANCA                         What happened? I thought we were

                  Look at, ladies. I could sit here                         and
 take turns throwing skittles at                         your ass all night. Bu
t I feel what                         you guys are putting out there. I'm
                   only a mirror reflecting what I'm                         ge

                   down and I'm saying I'll ride                         shotgu

 get scared.                         I'll stand up and let the wind blow
                  through my long blonde hair. With my
summer dress clinging to my bosom                         yelling 'Faster, Bill

                         her. Let it go, Sean.               Cynthia grabs the

     CYNTHIA                         I'm having fun , Sean. Can you
             handle that..? Yeah. He doesn't                         judge me.
                                    RICKY                         I don't wear

alright.               She hangs up.                                     RICKY
                        Now you girls wait here. I got a
  special surprise.               The girls are all waiting with Bobby as Ricky
 leaves the               room. Bobby does not make any attempt to keep the bal
l               rolling.               Cynthia whispers too loud and drunk.
                                 CYNTHIA                         Is he cute?
                                  BIANCA                         He's okay.
                                 CYNTHIA                         Should I fuck
him?                                     BIANCA                         I don't
 know. Do whatever you want.                                     CYNTHIA
                  He's great, right. Is he great?
       BIANCA                         He's alright.
         CYNTHIA                              (disappointed)
      I know.                                     BIANCA
       (cheerleader)                         But maybe that's okay. Maybe that'
s                         just what you need.
   BOBBY                         Can you excuse me for a minute?
Bobby leaves the room. He finds Ricky in a hotel robe               filling the
 BATHTUB.                                     BOBBY (continues) (CONT'D)
                  What the fuck's going on?
 RICKY                         Dude, get back out there. You gotta
            help me get them in the hot tub.                              (shou
ts)                         Hang on girls! Just get out there.
        I'll be right out. You know how I do.
   BOBBY                         Yeah, I know how you do. I know how
              you do. I've heard your kibbles and                         bits
all fucking night. You've been                         shaking your ass like an
 unemployed                         clown. How the room's a boiling pot
                 of sugar water. How you're gonna dip                         a
 string into it and make rockcandy.                         Who wants to play '
Just the tip?'                         Dancing around like a smacked ass.
                   Oh, and that coat check girl you've
been dragging around as 'insurance'                         doesn't even speak
English.                              (leaves)               Ricky checks the w

               Okay. We got a lot happening here.                         Here
comes the good part... Okay...                                     BIANCA
                        (re: robe)                         Somebody's getting c

 Where's the surprise?                                     RICKY
          You want your surprise?                                     CYNTHIA
                       Yeah. I want it.                                     RIC
KY                         Well, come on then. It's back here.               Cy
nthia leaves with Ricky. Bobby is left with Bianca and               the Asian
coat check girl. Bianca and he are uncomfortable.               After a long pa
use...                                     BIANCA                         You m
ind if I roll a joint?               Ricky sits in the BATHTUB with a glass of
champagne.                                     RICKY                         Yo
u want to come splash around.                                     CYNTHIA
                   I'm just warning you, I can't swim.               Then... Bi
anca sparks up. She offers to Bobby, who refuses.
       BIANCA                         I'm not like her, you know. I mean,
                   I'm not judging, but I'm more about
my dogs. Do you have dogs? Are you a                         dog guy?
                                                          CUT TO:
 Cynthia lets her towel drop. She dips her toe into the               water. Ou
t of nowhere she begins to wail. Back in the main               room Bobby, Bia
nca, and the Asian girl react to the               off-screen crying. Cynthia c
omes rushing out in a bathrobe,               bursting with tears. Ricky follow
s in a towel.                                     CYNTHIA
   I want to leave right now.                                     RICKY

BY                         What the hell did you do?
          RICKY                         I swear to God, I didn't do
             anything.                                     BIANCA
           Oh no. What is it this time.                                     CYN
THIA                         We used to take baths together.
                  BIANCA                         Come on. Let's go.
   Cynthia calls her boyfriend on the cell phone.
       CYNTHIA                         Sean? I want you to pick me up... I
                    know. I'm sorry too.               They leave.
                        BOBBY                         What the fuck was that ab

jonesing for me.               They notice the Asian girl still sitting there i
n the room.               Bobby hands her cab fare and escorts her out.
                             BOBBY                         Here you go, darling
. Get home safe.               BEEBEEP... BEEBEEP...Both their pagers go off.
                                   BOBBY (continues) (CONT'D)
       Fuck.               He reaches for the phone. Dials.
                 BOBBY (continues) (CONT'D)                         Hi.
                      (mouthes to Ricky)                         It's Ruiz.
                          (phone)                         Yeah. So the driver k
nows where to                         go? When? We'll be down in five. No,
                    I'll tell him. He's right there. Bye.
               RICKY                         What's up?
             BOBBY                         He wants to see us now.
                        RICKY                         Where?
                  BOBBY                         He said it's being arranged. He
                         said Jimmy will know.
    RICKY                         We're getting whacked.
              BOBBY                         We're not getting whacked.
                            RICKY                         Why else you think he
 won't tell us                         where the sit down is?
                   BOBBY                         It's not a 'sit down.' He said
 he's                         telling us the plan.               Ricky is wavin
g around a STEAK KNIFE from a room service               tray, testing the weig
ht and balance.                                     BOBBY (continues) (CONT'D)
                        What are you doing.
 RICKY                         I got a bad feeling, man. I don't
          want to go in naked.                                     BOBBY
                  You gonna shank him in the shower?
          RICKY                         Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz,
                     who doesn't even want us here, is
throwing us to the wolves? As an                         apology? And I don't e
ven know what                         we're dropping off or picking up -

                   just keep our mouthes shut and not                         m
ake any mistakes. Now hurry up and                         get your shit on so
we're not late                         and make things worse.

MOSINE - MANHATTAN - MORNING               Ricky and Bobby look awful. They hav

tattered               clothes, and yolk on their chin. Ricky lights a smoke.

        Everything looks sickening to our bloated drunks. The head

             They are lead to a table joining Ruiz and Horrace, who are
       both dressed appropriately for a society brunch.
             RUIZ                         Jesus Christ, where the fuck you
                    been all night? You look like you                         g

      too much. I love that old Jew, but                         he's gonna kil

 tell Peter Jennings to                         shut up and fucking listen. The
                         shit's as routine as you get. I
  coulda turned it over offshore in a                         week, but Maxie l
ikes to do it all                         his way. Safe. I coulda dropped the
                       bag alone. It's only two hundred
 G's. But he sent you all. So I can                         either send you hom
e and tell Maxie,                         or we can flush the toilet one more
                       time and hope it all goes down.

                       simpler. You carry the money to the
    Welshman, he checks it, hands you                         his marker, you'r
e done. The washed                         money goes directly to Maxie. Long
                       as you hand off the bag, you're

                      eight grand, maybe more. Maybe lost
   his whole line of clientele? He                         knows you're fucking
 up Jess'                         dancing, and I got a feeling he
           knows I stole his carpet cleaning                         van by the
 way he looks at me. He                         can't kill us in LA cause that
leads                         to too many questions. So he flies
          us out here first class for a 'drop'                         that's t
urned into whatever? He can                         make us disappear out here

                  Anyone have any drugs.               A wave of dread.

      Coke?                                     WELSHMAN
  I've heard you've got the best coke                         in the States. Th

                bills)                         That shouldn't be a problem.
           Ricky looks to Bobby, who shrugs. Ricky reluctantly goes
   off to find drugs. Tom smiles and hugs Bobby and Horrace.
                  WELSHMAN                         You guys are the fucking bes

A CLUB - LATER - NIGHT               Horrace, Ricky, Tom, and Bobby are all pac

          He starts rubbing the spillage from Bobby's lapel onto his
    gums. Horrace prevents any more waste by taking the envelope
away.                                     WELSHMAN (continues) (CONT'D)
                 Sorry, mates. Now there isn't even                         eno

  Here...               Horrace positions himself so that the Welshman can snif
f               from his hand. The four large men all reposition themselves
           in the tiny stall, inevitably stepping on each other and
   banging heads.                                     RICKY

    Fuck...               OUTSIDE THE STALL, the attendant watches the feet shu

          cocaine from Horrace's outstretched hand.
         WELSHMAN (continues) (CONT'D)                         Fuck, that's goo

                             HORRACE                         He must have that
shit troughed.                                     BOBBY
  What do you mean 'troughed?'                                     HORRACE
                    Troughed off. Protected. Like, you

    HORRACE                         Nah, man. No one is. They got some
                Puerto Ricans and a new crop of                         fuckin
Irish immigrants.                                     RICKY
     I'm half Irish.                                     HORRACE

                     BOBBY                         Heard of them.
                       HORRACE                         They ran shit back in th
e Eighties.                         Used to cut motherfuckers heads off
                 and sit them on the bar. That's back                         w
hen the Irish was making a play                         against the Italians. I

 to me like everybody's                         just a little jumpy. And since
all                         it is is a drop, the Welshman's got
         nothing at stake. I say we go to his                         'troughed
 off' bar. It'll calm his                         nerves, we drop the bag, and

EXT. CITY STREET - MANHATTAN - DAY               The limo pulls up, and Horrace

 anyone. There is a tension. Horrace is               on the phone.

    The limo passes the corner and settles in front of the time               w

 This is it.                                     BOBBY
Where's Ricky.                                     HORRACE
    I guess inside. Or he never made                         it. Either way, I
don't give a shit.                         Let's get this over with.
    EXT. ICARUS TAVERN - RED HOOK - CONTINUOUS               The two guys get o

t the door watches them enter and               snuffs out his smoke.
     INT. ICARUS TAVERN - RED HOOK - CONTINUOUS               They enter the ol
d world gin mill. It's dark. There's a               long, aged wooden bar and
oak booths. The floor boards are               faded and bowed. A middle-aged B
ARTENDER reads the Post by               the oversized beer taps. He looks up o
ver his reading               glasses without expression. Two young Irish TOUGH
S stand up               from a booth and lead the men into the back room. Ther

ROOM - ICARUS TAVERN - CONTINUOUS               Even darker. They slowly walk i

its in the center of               this sparse dining room. Three ROGUES sit ar
ound it, all               facing the door.  Tom, the Welshman, sits with his b
ack to               the door. They all have pints before them. A muted
       conversation ends as Tom follows their stares over his               sho
ulder to see Bobby and Horrace enter. Silence for a BEAT,               then...
                                     WELSHMAN                         Here they

        HORRACE                         That's alright, man. It's a little
                    early for me to drink.               This draws an uncomfor

 them.                                     WELSHMAN                         Non

re's the money.               Horrace places the case on the table. Its weight
makes a               loud thunk as it hits the hardwood. He pops the catch and
               lifts the lid. Wow. That's a lot of money. The toughs lose
         their poker faces as their knees weaken from the sight of
  it. Even Bobby has to swallow as the Devil blows on his               nape. T
om fingers the stacks.                                     HORRACE (continues)

                       I can't yet vouch for the amount,
  unless you want me to sit here and                         count.
                         HORRACE                         No, man, that's fine.
Just put that                         you took delivery.               Then, in
 what takes only a matter of seconds, Bobby has a               LOCKBLADE to hi
s THROAT and Horrace takes a truncheon to the               gut, flooring him.
                                    HORRACE (continues) (CONT'D)
          What the fuck, man? Why? The                         money's in your
hand. Why you                         pulling this shit?               Tom is s

S.)                         Maybe you're the one who better
     shut up.               They all turn to see RICKY standing tall with a PIS
TOL to               the head of a tough with two beers. Ricky sips the third
             lager.                                     ROGUE
       He's only got six shots, he's bound                         to miss.
                                 RICKY                         Or maybe I'm rea

ou don't take that knife away from                         my friends throat.
             The thug removes the blade from Bobby's neck. His eyes
   narrow as he looks at the gun. He notices something...
               THUG                         That's a starter pistol.
                          RICKY                              (covering)
                 What?                                     THUG
         His gun's a starter pistol. I can                         see the red
plug in the barrel.               The toughs begin to relax and converge...
                                 RICKY                              (nervous)
                       Are you willing to risk your life
  over-               But the moment proves enough of a distraction for Bobby t
o               unload a damaging COMBINATION to his captor. He may not have
            what it takes to cut it as a professional boxer, but these
      untrained goons are way outclassed. He drops one like a lead
  weight. It's about to get ugly as weapons are raised.               Then... T
he melee is cut short by a resounding VOICE calling               from the door

          the crowd.               They all freeze.

          him a card.)                         E-mail it to me. A check will
                      arrive. Call the number at the                         bo

the card.                              (to Bobby)                         Nice.
 I'll let Maxie know you're                         good in the pocket.

ve               ever seen them. They've obviously not slept or changed yet
           and flew right out after the melee.               Maxie looks at the
 open case of cash.               A long, tense BEAT of unclear reaction. Is Ma
xie mad or               happy. Finally...
MAX                         You did good.               He throws them each a b

 both came                         through. I should've been informed
               there was a flag on the play, but                         I'll t
ake that up with Ruiz. I made                         a few calls back East. Th
ose punks                         weren't tied in with anyone. As for
               the Welshman, he wasn't in on it. He                         was
 just plain dumb. As for you,                         Ricky, your draw will go
towards a                         new carpet cleaning van.

            RICKY                         Yes, sir.
         MAX                         And, as for you, Bobby, you just
               moved up a notch. Your days of                         fighting

              BOBBY                         There won't be a next thing.

                  MAX                         Hate to ruin your fairy tale, but
                         I've been paying Jess' rent for six
      months. She's got to keep dancing-               Bobby throws his stack o

         INT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - BLACKBURN - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT               T

es are strewn all over. Half eaten plates of food               are on the coff

          Chloe looks to the back room as she sips from her juice
 box. Bobby sees a MIRROR and COKE laid out on the table. He               grit

BBY                         Just so you know, I bought you out

BBY                         I, uh ... Listen, hon. Mommy thinks
         it's a good idea if, just for a                         while, if you
and me go on a trip-               Before he can finish, his stammering is cut
short by her               bolting across the room and into his arms.
     She squeezes him with all her might.               We see Bobby's relief a

on a beautiful sunny morning travelling on an               empty desert road.
The only car visible is Bobby's Trans Am               in the deep background,
leaving the mountains behind. The               CAMERA TRACKS BACKWARDS along t
he road as the car closes               slowly. We hear Chloe's angelic voice a
s she sings a melody.               As the car draws closer, we see Bobby, stil
l in the clothes               from the trip, driving. There is luggage packed
for a               journey. Bobby looks content. When the car finally settles
              into a TWO-SHOT through the windshield, we notice SMOKE
     coming from the back seat. A moment later, Ricky sits up               beh
